"Article courtesy of: Carol Petersen RPh CNP  Influenza (flu) is defined as an acute, commonly epidemic disease, occurring in several forms, caused by numerous rapidly mutating viral strains and characterized by respiratory symptoms and general prostration. (1) The flu has a major impact on the lungs. Colds start in the nose and upper respiratory tract. Vomiting and diarrhea are assigned to yet another viral family.  Corona Virus  We are currently in the grip of a media frenzy and potential public health disaster. A new type of corona virus has emerged from a large city in China, Wuhan, and the world is bracing for an impact of a major epidemic. We have been here before, however, we have already experienced MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) and SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) along with the same specter of massive numbers of deaths. Corona viruses are thought to be generally mild and not very virulent. This type of virus is found very commonly in animals. Some now believe that the virus for MERS, SARS and now the Wuhan Virus has somehow unnaturally been transmitted to humans, and humans have now become another vector for this infection.  Western Medicine, Louis Pasteur and Antoine Béchamp  We have developed Western medicine primarily by following the teaching of French chemist Louis Pasteur (1822-1895) and the Germ Theory of Disease. Pasteur believed that diseases were caused by outside pathogens invading the body. Antoine Béchamp a Pasteur contemporary, disagreed. He believed that it was that the condition of the body, the terrain, was the source of illness. A healthy body is dependent upon its acid/base balance; its charge; the amount of toxicity and its nutritional status. Only tissue that is already diseased can harbor organisms that become pathogenic. We are starting to appreciate our complicated relationships with the microbial world as we have begun to explore the wonderful world of our microbiomes. This disease theories of Pasteur have led us to the doctrines of virology and immunology. This evolution began before we learned anything about vitamins, trace minerals and other nutrients. (2)  Vaccinate!  Western medicine is now leaving the world of antibiotics. Antibiotics are failing and have served to create more pathogens that are resistant to antibiotic treatments. Western medicine is now embracing vaccination. And why not? There are untold numbers of microbes and 7.8 billion people on earth to experiment upon. Pharmaceutical companies have more and more vaccines in their pipelines. All they must do is to convince us and our governments that their vaccines are the only thing that saves us from vast epidemics, severe illness and probably death. And not a surprise the Corona virus has already been patented. Even at best, this season’s flu vaccines have already proven to be 70% ineffective. The promise of herd immunity does not hold up with vaccinated populations. (3)  Nine Months to a Corona Vaccine  On January 23, 2020 the company Moderna, Inc announced that it is partnering with the US National Institutes of Health (4) to develop a vaccine to prevent infection by the corona virus within the next 9 months. They promise new technology to address this life-threatening epidemic. Sound good? It might be if vaccinations worked. It might be if organisms didn’t rapidly mutate to new forms as they pass through their vectors. It might be if vaccines didn’t also depend on heavy metals to aggravate the immune system. It might be if animal and human DNA from the viral growth medium weren’t injected into the body without any clue for the long-term consequences. Vaccines do not work.  How is the Flu Deadly?  Most of us have experienced the respiratory illness that is characterized as the flu at some point in our lives. Temperatures rise as it is part of the body’s natural defense mechanism, but not always. There are aches and pains and general malaise and coughing. Most of us take to our beds until we feel better. However, some days after the viral assault, pneumonia (inflammation of the lungs), caused by bacteria can set in. This infection can become life threatening as it spreads, and organ systems become compromised. If someone is already struggling with organ system problems, let’s say with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or renal issues, this can become the tipping point. The infection can lead to sepsis, a systemic inflammatory response, shutting down organ systems leading to death. Even in young healthy people, this response, also called a cytokine storm, can overwhelm the body.  Back to Antoine Béchamp  This is the other option. We can choose to help our body’s terrain remain in its healthy state, and if we get sick we can choose to return our body to that healthy state rather than embrace warfare on our microbial world and be left with the consequences of the “friendly fire”. The rest of this article will focus on staying well and getting well despite a flu epidemic. Admittedly, it is getting to be more and more difficult. Our water, our air and our food have become compromised like never before in human history.  Basic and Free (or almost)  Wash your hands. We can’t live our lives and avoid contact with other people. However, we can minimize the challenges to our immune system by frequently washing your hands. After the SARS outbreak in 2003, a Toronto epidemiologist related that the installation of numerous handwashing stations and maintaining sanitary protocols stopped the spread of SARS in its tracks. (5)  Plain soap and water will do. You can find alcohol and chemical wipes everywhere, but this is not the best choice as these chemicals strip your skin of their natural oils which also protect you. It’s better to use wipes that have been infused with essential oils. Essential oils have power antiviral activities and can be inhaled and infused. Using a diffuser in public spaces such as schools could cut down viral transmission. This reference holds a long list of the most effective essential oils and herbal remedies. (6)  The So-Called Flu Season.  “...it has been my observation that those patients receiving a Vitamin D injection in the fall have never had a substantial cold or flu during the winter. Interestingly, the dose of a single injection is 400,000 IU (International Units). While that seems a substantial dose, after administering many thousands of injections, I have never seen an example of the Vitamin D levels climbing too high. As a matter of fact, some individuals are so depleted at the intracellular level that they might need 2 or 3 injections over the winter months to preserve optimal levels of vitamin D.” Dr. Dale Guyer, Indianapolis posting in Facebook.  Vitamin D is a primary tool for preventing infection of all kinds. The flu season coincides with the greatest lack of sunshine and the opportunity to create vitamin D in the skin. It is easily supplemented. Optimal levels should be 70-80 ng/ml. Supplementing vitamin D can be preventative. High doses can be used to treat an acute incidence of the flu. (7)  Linus Pauling and Vitamin C  Linus Pauling’s claim to fame was to make vitamin C a household word. He extolled the virtues of vitamin for prevention and treatment for colds and the flu. Vitamin C can be used in smaller doses as prevention and ramped up to bowel tolerance for treatment. In severe cases, a physician may offer even higher doses in an IV treatment to speed recovery from the flu. Using vitamin C in a phospholipid delivery system can also provide higher and effective doses. (8)  Hydrocortisone  Dr. William Jefferies spent his entire career studying hydrocortisone or cortisol. In his 80’s, he made an interesting discovery. After deliberately infecting some volunteer students, he discovered that the virus inhibited the pituitary hormone ACTH which is responsible for the adrenal production of hydrocortisone. That feeling of malaise and the aches and pains and headaches that come with the flu are quickly eradicated by using supplemental hydrocortisone. Practitioners can provide the drug Cortef to be used orally. However, hydrocortisone 1 % cream can be found in drug stores and applied to the skin. To prevent the flu, establish that there are no underlying hydrocortisone deficiencies. Practitioners rely on an Adrenal Stress Index saliva test or morning cortisol in the serum to identify problems. Dr. Jefferies used maintenance doses such as 5 mg of hydrocortisone every 6 hours. In the case of an acute flu, larger doses should be used immediately, and relief is rapid. (9)  Ozone  Antibiotics are starting to fail as mentioned above. But we really don’t have to worry much despite the dire prognostications. Ozone, a gas, which is a very reactive form of oxygen can treat any infection. Ozone treated water can be used in hand washing and cleaning surfaces. Ozonated oils such as olive oil can be gargled if there is a sore throat. You can use ozone in your ears, vaginally, or rectally for a full body treatment. You can also ozonate your bath water. A practitioner can help you with intravenous options if a serious infection has persisted. The American Association of Ozone Therapy is a great resource to learn about ozone. (10)  To Be Continued  We are just scratching the surface so far on all the methods we may use to deter getting an infection and what steps we can take to treat an infection. Humanity has survived on the earth for millions of years. There are multiple modalities, both conventional and traditional that can strengthen the immune system and help prevent infections. We can open the door to rediscover and identify our rich histories of healing modalities. We have choices. We don’t have to rely only on hastily devised, unproven and untested therapies alone.

"Becoming the world's most advanced and largest professional mitochondrial technology and manufacturing leader is the vision of most biotech companies in the field of mitochondria and mitochondrial research, and preventive medicine.  Mitochondrial disorders are multi-systemic and commonplace, and it belongs to a prevalent category of inherited neurometabolic diseases (prevalence: 1:4300). Such diseases are clinically, genetically and chemically heterogeneous so that recognition and diagnosis are frequently difficult, but thankfully, for most of the patients, recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has led to great improvements in genetic diagnosis. Due to the variability of features and nature of the biochemical or genetic defects, early referral to a specialized center is recommended because improved diagnostics and NGS use have enabled an earlier diagnosis for many, as well as sometimes early instigation of effective therapy and precision medicine.  There is currently no cure available for the majority of such conditions, and clinical care is largely restricted to negating the complications of these diseases or assisting prevention through prenatal testing, mitochondrial donation therapy and preimplantation genetic diagnosis. As such, the limited options and lack of curative treatment options have created more opportunities and investments into individual therapy trials, focused on optimizing oxidative phosphorylation and improving antioxidant capacity. In essence, a combination of vitamins, including coenzyme Q10 (ubiquinone), thiamine and riboflavin in addition to other regenerative medicinal approaches in the telomeres, stem cell and senescent cells is recommended. As of February 2020, more than 250 trials are ongoing worldwide investigating potential therapeutic approaches.  Mitochondrion Application Biomedicine Inc. (MAB or MitoBioMed) is one such company conducting such trials and aims to fulfil this mission by forming a strong competitive team with our medical institutions and customers, as a long-term and trusted technology and capacity provider in the global mitochondrial /cell therapy industry. Scientists are working night and day, racing to find a cure for the novel coronavirus. An East-meets-West combination of medicines is now suggested to be the recommended course.  With the advent of an ageing society, many studies in the past ten years have shown that mitochondria are closely related to ageing and degenerative diseases (such as neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, etc). This is because when mitochondrial function is abnormal, it will trigger a lack of energy supply and oxidative stress, and even induce cells to enter apoptosis or autophagy, which will cause disease.  MAB also establishes a series of training and certification mechanisms for medical personnel (such as doctors) and cooperates with medical institutions and academic institutions around the world. This makes it a prime candidate for impact investing towards sustainability development, in alignment with the United Nations and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  The Company along with other biotech companies in the field have developed many product lines, including mitochondrial activated stem cells (Mitocell), mitochondrial biologics (Mitobio), mitochondrial activated immune cells (MAKcell), mitochondrial function tests (Mitoscan), mitochondrial aesthetic medicine, mitochondrial cell bank(Mitobank), mitochondria activated herbal extracts (Dynamito), mitochondria activated health food (Mitofood), mitochondria activation culture medium(Stemoto), etc., Mitocell, Mitobio, and MAKcell are all ready for the next phase of clinical development. Other products are cooperatively sold in the fields of preventive health care, medical beauty, cell culture, detection and analysis. These products have proven safety and effectiveness in preliminary studies.  Furthermore, Mitochondria for stem cell therapy is another frontier for regenerative medicine. Stem cells are primitive and unspecialized cells, they are a type of cells that are not sufficiently differentiated and have the potential to regenerate various tissues and organs. In medicine, stem cells have long been considered to have potential for medical applications because of their strong potential for treating physical damage caused by disease, aging, genetic factors or trauma. In international research, mitochondria are an important factor affecting the quality of stem cells. By analyzing the function of mitochondria in stem cells as a way to identify the quality of cells, it provides a scientific way to identify cell quality. The company's research is to improve the quality and function of stem cells by screening and increasing mitochondrial function. Stem cells activated by mitochondria have better therapeutic effects. Our company's mitochondrial activated stem cells have also been proven to be useful in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, Osteoarthritis, Multiple System Atrophy  Lastly, in addition to the aforementioned products in the market, mitochondrial replacement techniques (MRT) work to prevent transmitting mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) diseases from mother to the next generation. Such diseases vary in presentation and severity. The goal of MRT is to prevent the transmission of such diseases by creating an embryo with nuclear DNA (nDNA) from the intended mother and mtDNA from a woman with non-pathogenic mtDNA through modification of either an oocyte (egg) or zygote (fertilized egg). This will help alleviate common symptoms including developmental delays, seizures, weakness and fatigue, muscle weakness, vision loss, and heart problems, which in combination lead to an increase of morbidity and in some cases premature death. While research continues to be conducted, if effective, MRT could satisfy the desire of women seeking to have a genetically related child without the risk of passing on mtDNA disease.  In the US alone, mitochondrial diseases affect around 1 in 5,000 individuals. It is also estimated that 1,000-4,000 children are born with a mitochondrial disease every year Therefore, there is a direct need to focus on building a world class professional mitochondrial technology and manufacturing leader, with a purpose in creating affordable healthcare and biotech leadership in preventative medicine. It also creates a space for the community of social impact investing to be more deeply involved in health and wellbeing.",0
"Coronavirus Is Making It Even Harder For The Census To Count Every U.S. Resident  Enlarge this image toggle caption Yuki Iwamura/Bloomberg via Getty Images Yuki Iwamura/Bloomberg via Getty Images  Updated March 15 at 6:47 p.m. ET  Already saddled with cybersecurity risks, hiring challenges and wavering public trust, the 2020 census now must contend with a growing public health crisis.  NPR has learned that at least one U.S. Census Bureau employee — who was recently hired as a supervisor for a group of door knockers, spokesperson Michael Cook says, and has not interacted with the public on behalf of the bureau — has tested positive for COVID-19 and has been quarantined.  ""The employee is following guidance of the Iowa Department of Public Health,"" Cook said in an email.  Because of the coronavirus pandemic, the bureau has decided to delay starting its early round of door-knocking by census workers in college towns to April 23. The bureau is also waiting until early April, instead of late March, to begin its outreach effort to send out representatives with computer tablets to help people submit their census responses online. That program, which is expected to cost at least $100 million, is designed to target people in high-traffic locations, from public transit hubs to grocery stores.  The uncertain timeline of the coronavirus outbreaks, however, could further complicate the constitutionally mandated head count of every U.S. resident. Major disruptions could derail the Census Bureau from gathering accurate numbers used to determine how many congressional seats and Electoral College votes each state gets for the next 10 years. The data also guide the redrawing of voting districts and the distribution of as much as $1.5 trillion a year in federal funding for healthcare, schools, roads and other public services to local communities.  Here's what to look for as the count — scheduled to continue through July — rolls out around the country:  The ""safest"" way to do the census is on your own  Without leaving home, you can take about 10 minutes now to submit a response on behalf of your household — either online at my2020census.gov or over the phone.  If you prefer paper, all households that haven't responded by early April are expected to receive a physical questionnaire in the mail. Some households in areas with low Internet subscription rates, and communities with higher shares of residents over age 65, are set to receive paper forms by March 20.  Those would be ""the safest"" ways to do the census because they involve little to no person-to-person contact, says John Thompson, a former Census Bureau director who left the agency in 2017.  But the key is to turn in your household's legally required response as soon as possible, Thompson adds. Otherwise, your home address is likely to be added to the list of places for census workers to visit in person beginning May 13. College students living off-campus may get a door knock starting April 23, instead of April 9, Cook, the bureau spokesperson, tells NPR.  ""It is critical that households understand that self-responding to the census can help alleviate additional burdens to the Bureau, brought on by COVID-19,"" Arturo Vargas, a longtime census advocate and CEO of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials Educational Fund, says in a written statement.  As of Saturday, 3 million households have submitted an online response to my2020census.gov since it was soft-launched on Monday, according to Cook.  ""The Census Bureau is ready for you to do the same,"" Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who oversees the bureau, said in a written statement. ""If you do, there will be no need for census takers to knock on your door.""  Can the census be delayed?  The Census Bureau has been planning to conduct the national head count through July 31. But this week, some Democratic members of Congress have been calling for the counting to be extended.  Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Adriano Espaillat — both of New York — along with 10 other Congressional Hispanic Caucus members, are urging the bureau to continue the count for an additional three months through October. A separate group of New York lawmakers led by Rep. Yvette Clarke wants the bureau to extend counting at least through September ""due to the social disruption caused by COVID-19.""  ""Social distancing will make enumeration practically impossible during the current allotted time frame,"" Clarke and the other lawmakers wrote in a letter to Ross.  In response to the coronavirus, some tribal nations are increasing their security by limiting who can enter tribal territories, according to Lycia Maddocks, vice president of external affairs at the National Congress of American Indians.  ""Some nations actually have physical guard stands where they can check to see if you're a tribal citizen,"" Maddocks, a citizen of the Quechan Tribe, said during a news conference Friday.  That could exacerbate the undercount of American Indians and Alaska Natives, who had the highest net undercount rate among all racial and ethnic groups in the 2010 census, according to the bureau's estimates. The delivery of census mailings could be delayed and census workers may not be able to travel in Indian Country, where there is often limited or no high-speed Internet service.  The bureau told the House Oversight and Reform Committee this week it's watching to see how many households respond on their own before deciding whether to continue counting past July. The bureau has said it is prepared to delay sending out census workers to specific areas where there is an outbreak.  Still, the bureau is under pressure to meet a critical deadline: Under federal law, the Census Bureau is required to deliver the latest population counts of each state to the president by Dec. 31.  ""If they have to delay too long, then they would have to work with the Congress and see if they would pass a new law to extend the deadline for the census,"" Thompson, the former bureau director, says.  Asked by NPR on Thursday whether the bureau is considering making such a request to Congress, the bureau's current director, Steven Dillingham, said: ""I wouldn't take anything off the table, but that's the first mention I've heard of that possibility.""  Will the Census Bureau be able to hire and protect a half-million census workers?  The bureau is currently trying to hire and train as many as a half-million census workers to follow up with households that don't fill out a form themselves. These workers are critical to the bureau's strategy for making sure historically undercounted groups — including communities of color, rural residents and immigrants — are included in the country's population count.  ""Historically, Black and Latino households, among others, have lower self-response rates, which means the Census Bureau needs enough manpower in the field to collect census information in-person in these communities,"" Terri Ann Lowenthal, a census consultant who once served as the staff director of the former House oversight subcommittee for the census, says in an email.  The bureau told the House Oversight and Reform Committee this week there has not been a significant drop in staffing since the outbreak.  But Cook, the bureau spokesperson, tells NPR that the bureau learned on Friday that the newly hired census field supervisor, who is now quarantined, tested positive for COVID-19. While that employee, who was expected to be based from home, has not engaged with the public on behalf of the bureau, Cooks says the individual interacted with other recently hired census workers and trainers during a new employee training session.  ""The very limited number of employees with whom the individual was in contact have been notified by public health authorities and are in self-quarantine,"" Cook says in a written statement to NPR. ""We will continue to provide support to any and all impacted employees and follow all public health authority guidance.""  Cooks adds the bureau is not aware of any ""work-related public activity"" by the employees in self-quarantine.  The bureau told lawmakers that it's planning to conduct more online training sessions and give workers safety equipment. Cook tells NPR the bureau is working on including social distancing techniques in trainings for door knockers, known as enumerators, and other on-the-ground census workers. Those who feel sick are ""strongly encouraged"" to stay at home, Cook adds. Enumerators do not get sick leave, but Cook says the bureau is looking into ways to pay them for a work-related injury or illness.  Still, on Friday, the Commerce Department Office of Inspector General, an internal watchdog group for the bureau, asked the agency to provide more details by March 20 on how it plans to conduct the count at ""a time of unprecedented turmoil and uncertainty.""  Thompson, the former bureau director, worries that trying to convince people to work for the census could be a ""particularly sensitive issue,"" especially among retirees over the age of 60. Given the low employment rate, they've been among the groups targeted by the bureau's recruiting efforts. But now they are at higher risk than younger age groups of becoming seriously ill with COVID-19.  Kevin Dowd, 62, a retired accountant who applied for a 2020 census job and lives near Milford, Pa., says he recently decided not to attend a training session for prospective enumerators because he was worried about getting sick.  ""How many people would be in how big a room?"" Dowd says he wondered. ""Many people have come back from vacation, from places that have more cases, and so I decided that I didn't need the $16 an hour.""  How will the homeless population be counted?  The bureau may decide next week to push back its schedule for counting people experiencing homelessness who are staying in shelters, Cook, the bureau spokesperson, tells NPR. That count is currently set for March 30 through April 1.  The agency is also evaluating whether to delay its April 1 count of homeless people living outside of shelters and in public parks, under bridges and other outdoor locations.  Shelters can choose to have a census worker visit their facility to interview residents and other people who use their services. But rising health concerns about COVID-19 raise two potential challenges, Thompson, the former bureau director, says.  ""Workers could be reluctant to go to a place where the homeless receive services,"" Thompson says. ""The places could be reluctant to let people in.""  Cook says the agency is trying to contact facilities that had planned for an in-person count to ask whether they can switch to paper forms instead.  In New York City — home to the country's largest homeless population — census workers are not expected to visit city-owned shelters because the local department of social services is transferring records about the shelters' residents to the Census Bureau, Julie Menin, the city's census director, tells NPR.  ""What this really does is ensures that every single homeless person in New York City is properly counted,"" Menin says. ""We don't want anyone to be overlooked. We don't want anyone to be invisible.""  How will college students, nursing home residents and prisoners be counted?  Cook says the bureau is trying to encourage 68,000 nursing homes, prisons and other group living facilities, excluding college dorms, to send in information about their residents online or by paper, rather than waiting for a census worker to do in-person interviews starting in early April.  Close to 12,900 dorms had chosen earlier this year to have the bureau drop off paper forms for each of their student residents to fill out individually. Given the chaotic situation at many campuses, however, the bureau is reaching out to the administrators to see if they want to change those plans.  The canceling of in-person classes and dorm closures at a growing number of colleges and universities have also raised concerns about whether students who live away from their families' homes will be counted in the right place.  In general, the bureau says all U.S. residents should be counted where they usually live and sleep, even if they're away on Census Day (April 1). This week, the bureau confirmed to NPR that students who have left their college town because of coronavirus should still use their address at school when filling out a census form.  But it's not clear if that guidance will reach students who have scattered around the country, some scrambling to find last-minute housing. In a letter to the Department of Education, the bureau suggests that schools contact their students who usually live off-campus about how to get counted on their own using my2020census.gov.  How will community groups help promote the census?  For decades, the bureau has relied on parades, street festivals and worship services as opportunities for local community leaders to encourage participation in the census.  ""The person-to-person contact can be much more effective than a letter in the mail,"" says Nancy Potok, a former deputy director at the Census Bureau who recently retired as the chief statistician of the U.S.  But the coronavirus is forcing census advocates to pivot away from in-person outreach activities. John Park, executive director of the MinKwon Center — a community group based in Queens, N.Y. — says his organization has been scaling down door-knocking and ramping up texting and phone-banking to encourage households to fill out the census on their own.  ""We've created multi-lingual T-shirts with QR codes that link to the census self-response URL, which will let people keep their distance but still access the survey,"" Park says in an email.  Still, for now, the bureau plans to move forward with its outreach efforts through its ""Mobile Questionnaire Assistance"" program after delaying the initial rollout from March 30 to April 6, Cook tells NPR. By April 13, census workers are expected to fan out with computer tablets around the country in areas with low census response rates to help people get counted online.  Will the coronavirus shut down census call centers and processing centers for paper forms?  While the bureau hopes most households use my2020census.gov, it's still collecting paper questionnaires, which are a critical backstop in case of any major technical breakdowns with the online census form.  ""One area that people tend to overlook is the importance of the processing centers,"" Potok, the former deputy director of the bureau, says about the two data processing centers in Phoenix and Jeffersonville, Ind., which is across the river from Louisville, Ky., for the 2020 census. ""People need to be there to check in the questionnaires.""  The centers can receive, separate and scan as many as 30 million paper questionnaires for the 2020 census, according to the bureau's plan for its paper data capture operation. Processing those paper forms will help the bureau figure out where they need to send workers to follow up with unresponsive households.  Deb Stempowski, an assistant director at the bureau who's in charge of operations and schedules for the 2020 census, says if there are any interruptions at one of the sites, the other center could pick up the extra work. Stempowski adds the bureau is tracking paper forms that are mailed back as soon as they enter the mail stream, and the agency is prepared to ask employees to work longer shifts or on the weekends if needed.  ""I don't believe that we have an issue if we have one or two people who can no longer support the work in one of the centers,"" Stempowski said.  Still, there is a risk of both facilities having to close because of the coronavirus outbreak.  The pandemic could also complicate staffing at the call centers that are receiving census responses over the phone and answering questions about the count in 13 languages. The 10 census questionnaire assistance centers are located in Tempe, Ariz.; Pueblo, Colo.; Jacksonville, Fla.; Tamarac, Fla.; Kansas City, Mo.; New York City; Blytheville, S.C.; El Paso, Texas; Irving, Texas; and Nashville, Tenn.  ""We have a significant contingency budget in place, which enables us to move offices if needed,"" Cook tells NPR, referring to a $2 billion budget set aside for 2020 census emergencies.  Will the coronavirus force the bureau to rely more heavily on government records to fill in missing information?  If the outbreak ultimately makes it impossible to gather self-reported information from certain households in time, the bureau may have to turn to alternatives to fill in the gaps, including a cache of existing government records from other federal agencies such as the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Postal Service.  ""It is possible that administrative records will have to enumerate a much larger share of the population as the virus spreads,"" Kenneth Prewitt, a former Census Bureau director who oversaw the 2000 count, wrote in an op-ed this week in The New York Times.  Some critics worry that relying on records to complete demographic profiles of certain households may not produce accurate census information.  ""We find these records work well in matching records for the White and higher-income populations but racial/ethnic minorities, lower-income persons, and other HTC populations are likely to be missed,"" members of a working group of Census Bureau researchers and advisors to the bureau wrote in a 2016 report.  Before the outbreak, the bureau estimated that about 7.9 million households — or just over 5% of the around 147 million home addresses it's planning to include in the 2020 census — will be counted using administrative records, according to a regulatory document filed in January with the White House's Office of Management and Budget.  Bureau officials said in the document that if the bureau ""does not have confidence"" in the records for an unresponsive household because of missing or inconsistent data, they plan to continue sending census workers to knock on the door.  According to the bureau's plans, workers are generally supposed to try to gather information in person in up to six days in total. At a time of outbreak, however, it's hard to say how many visits will actually be possible later this year.",1
"Instagram is attempting to stop the spread of misinformation about the novel coronavirus pandemic that’s surfacing through its augmented reality effects. In an update to its AR creators Facebook group, the company wrote that it has removed already-published AR effects and will reject any pending requests for effects that claim to “predict, diagnose, treat, or cure coronavirus.” It’s also not allowing users to search for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, AR effects on Instagram unless they were developed with a “recognized health organization.”  Certain offending filters have quizzed users on whether they have the virus or directly referenced panic-buying because of the pandemic. Beyond its AR effects, Instagram also directs people to reputable sources of information about the virus when they search certain hashtags. In January, it started blocking and restricting hashtags that spread misinformation and began removing posts that advertised fake cures or prevention methods.",1
"As the coronavirus pandemic continues to worsen in the US, NASA is still moving forward with many of its upcoming missions, including some launches that will send humans to the International Space Station in the near future. As of now, NASA does not foresee any changes being made to these missions, and there are already procedures in place to guarantee astronauts do not bring any illnesses with them into space.  NASA has its own internal “response framework” for how it plans to deal with the pandemic. It lists four different stages for the agency, which each detail the amount of people who will work from home, the level of access to NASA facilities, and how much travel will be allowed. Right now, two NASA centers — Ames Research Center and Marshall Space Flight Center — are on Stage 3, which makes telework mandatory and only allows “mission-essential” personnel on site at facilities. NASA bumped these two centers to Stage 3 after employees tested positive for COVID-19 at each place.  NASA has its own internal “response framework” for how to deal with the pandemic  NASA’s Johnson Space Center, which oversees the agency’s human spaceflight launches and operates the International Space Station, is only at Stage 2. At that level, teleworking is strongly encouraged, though not mandatory, while various facilities are closed down. “The health and safety of NASA’s workforce is the agency’s top priority. As the coronavirus (COVID-19) concern continues to escalate, NASA is taking steps to ensure its workforce is protected and informed,” a NASA spokesperson at JSC said in a statement.  But as more workers at JSC stay home, they’re still looking ahead to the next launch of people to the ISS, which is slated for April 9th out of Kazakhstan. A Russian Soyuz rocket will launch three crew members, including NASA astronaut Chris Cassidy, to the station, where they’ll join three people already in orbit.  That launch is still on, and NASA says the agency hasn’t made any changes to operations and schedule surrounding the mission. As of yesterday, Kazakhstan effectively closed its borders after reporting its first coronavirus cases in the country. No one can enter the country except for diplomats, returning citizens, and those invited by the country’s government, according to Reuters. NASA is still assessing if changes are needed regarding how personnel will travel to Kazakhstan.  Of course, the concern is that the astronauts flying to the station could carry the coronavirus with them, if they don’t know that they’re infected with the virus. But NASA already has a long-held strategy in place for preventing astronauts from carrying any nasty bugs with them to space. All astronauts going to orbit must go through a two-week period of quarantine called “health stabilization,” according to NASA. That way, the agency can make sure the crew is not incubating any illnesses before launch. However, NASA said it “will continue to evaluate and augment this plan, in coordination with its international and commercial partners” if needed.  In the meantime, Russia’s state space corporation, Roscosmos, has decided to shut down all media activity surrounding the Soyuz launch, barring journalists from covering the mission in person. Russia will still live stream the launch, and NASA typically airs all of its crewed launches on its own online TV channel.  All astronauts going to orbit must go through a two-week period of quarantine  Once this launch is over, the next big milestone for JSC is the return of crew from the ISS. NASA astronauts Andrew Morgan, Jessica Meir, and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Skripochka are slated to return to Earth in a Soyuz capsule in mid-April, landing in the Kazakhstan desert. Such landings typically require large groups of recovery personnel to extract the astronauts from the landed capsule. NASA did not provide any details if those operations would change in light of the pandemic.  However, NASA has more than one upcoming crewed mission on its calendar. Soon, NASA’s commercial partner SpaceX will be ready to send its first crew of NASA astronauts to the International Space Station. The launch is a critical one for NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, an initiative to develop privately funded vehicles to transport people to and from the ISS. SpaceX has been developing its Crew Dragon capsule for the program, and the first vehicle that will fly a crew of two to the station is already in Florida ahead of its inaugural flight.  SpaceX is currently targeting May for that flight, according to the company’s president Gwynne Shotwell. NASA also says that SpaceX’s passengers for the mission, astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley, are continuing to train for the mission as originally planned. As for operations at SpaceX, it seems like things are still moving ahead as usual. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk sent an email last week to the company’s employees underplaying the coronavirus threat, arguing people were more likely to die in a car crash than from the virus.  Of course, the situations at NASA and SpaceX are subject to change quickly. The coronavirus pandemic is ever-evolving, with cities, states, and countries making swift changes every few hours to combat the spread of the disease. And already, launches are being affected. Europe’s primary spaceport in French Guiana, South America is suspending all launches from the site for the foreseeable future, in order to protect the health of employees and people in the area.  It’s possible that upcoming launches from the US could be postponed as well. It just depends on how companies plan to react and if governments take even more decisive action.",1
"It is known [1] that coronaviruses bind to target cells via angiotensin converting enzyme 2. COVID-19 attaches and binds to target cells through ACE2 protein sites on cells of the lung, intestine, kidneys and blood vessels.  Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 sites are increased [2] by Ibuprofen, antihypertensive medications such as ACE inhibitors, ARBS, Thiazolidedinones, as well as type 1 and type 2 diabetes.  The most frequent comorbidities include diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and cerebrovascular diseases that have been reported thus far in those with COVID-19, and these are typically treated with ACE inhibitors, although this was not mentioned in the studies.  The higher level of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 may increase infection with COVID-19 and consequently may also increase the risks for both severe and fatal infection of the COVID-19 virus. However, antihypertensive calcium channel blockers [3] don’t increase ACE2, and should be taken into consideration as a possible alternative drug and may be worth having a conversation with your prescribing physician about.  Examples of angiotensin converting enzyme ACE inhibitors include:  Captopril (Capoten),  Enalapril (Vasotec),  Fosinopril (Monopril),  Lisinopril (Prinivil, Zestril),  Moexipril (Univasc)  Perindopril (Aceon),  Quinapril (Accupril),  Ramipril (Altace),  Trandolapril (Mavik),  Benazepril (Lotensin, Lotensin Hct).

"Coronavirus Forces Bureau To Suspend Census Field Operations Until April 1  Enlarge this image toggle caption Amr Alfiky/NPR Amr Alfiky/NPR  Updated March 19 at 9:25 a.m. ET  The coronavirus pandemic is forcing the U.S. Census Bureau to temporarily suspend all field operations for the 2020 census for two weeks until April 1, the agency announced Wednesday in a statement on its website.  As the country continues to bunker down in response to the spread of COVID-19, the bureau's director, Steven Dillingham, says it is making the change ""to help protect the health and safety of the American public, Census Bureau employees, and everyone going through the hiring process for temporary census taker positions.""  For the next couple of weeks, the bureau is also reducing the number of on-site workers at two facilities in Jeffersonville, Ind., that process paper census forms, the bureau says in a separate statement on its website.  Another facility in Phoenix that also processes paper forms is ""adopting social distancing practices in line with guidance from health authorities,"" Michael Cook, a spokesperson for the bureau, told NPR in a statement on Thursday.  Many census advocates are worried that the ongoing public health crisis could jeopardize the bureau's ability to accurately count the U.S. population this year as required by the Constitution.  All U.S. households, however, can continue to respond to the census on their own either online at my2020census.gov, over the phone or by paper form, if they receive one. Official letters with instructions on how to participate in the national head count are expected to arrive at most homes by Friday.  The announcement comes days after the bureau confirmed to NPR on Saturday that it is delaying deploying door knockers to college towns until April 23 and waiting until early April to start sending out census workers with computer tablets to help people complete online forms.  Still, there has been a lot of uncertainty about how the bureau plans to protect early rounds of census workers expected to go door to door to count residents in remote parts of Alaska and Maine, and in some American Indian tribal territories. Other workers were set to leave paper questionnaires in Puerto Rico and other places recovering from natural disasters. The bureau had also been preparing to conduct an in-person count of people experiencing homelessness.  Recently hired enumerators, also known as door knockers, and other field staff have been gathering around the country for training sessions. The bureau confirmed to NPR on Saturday that at least one employee, who was hired to be a census field supervisor, has tested positive for COVID-19 and is in quarantine.  ""The employee is following guidance of the Iowa Department of Public Health,"" Michael Cook, a spokesperson for the bureau, said in a follow-up email on Sunday.  While that employee has not interacted with the public on behalf of the bureau, the census field supervisor was in contact with a ""very limited number of employees"" at a training session, and all of them are in self-quarantine, Cook said on Saturday.  The latest state population counts are due to the president by December 31, according to federal law.  The numbers of every person living in the U.S. determine each state's share of congressional seats and Electoral College votes for the next decade. They also guide how as much as $1.5 trillion a year in federal funding for Medicare, Medicaid and other public services are divided up among local communities.  In the written statement, Dillingham said that as of Wednesday morning, more than 11 million households have submitted a census response on their own through the Internet since March 9, when the online form at my2020census.gov was soft launched.  Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.), who helps oversee the 2020 census as the chair of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, says she hopes more households will continue to find ways to respond to the census during the temporary pause in field operations.  ""Every American should know that this does not affect your ability to self-respond,"" Maloney said in a statement. ""By responding now, you will ensure that the Census Bureau does not need to send a census worker to your door.",1
"Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk tweeted on Wednesday night that he’s willing to have his companies, Tesla and SpaceX, make crucial ventilators to help patients with severe symptoms of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio wants to take him up on that offer.  De Blasio tweeted at Musk on Thursday morning, saying New York City “will need thousands [of ventilators] over the next few weeks,” despite already acquiring them “as fast as we can.” The mayor said his team would reach out to Musk directly. “We could use your help!” he wrote. (After this article was published, Musk responded: “Sounds good, we will connect with your team to understand potential needs.)  “We could use your help!”  Musk had tweeted that he’d have his teams make ventilators “if there’s a shortage,” and by all accounts, there will be. The only reason it might not seem like there isn’t one currently in the US is that we haven’t yet exhausted the short supply. And while President Trump said he’s willing to invoke the wartime “Defense Production Act” on Wednesday to address the shortage, he tweeted later in the day that he’d only do so in a “worst case scenario.”  @elonmusk New York City is buying!    Our country is facing a drastic shortage and we need ventilators ASAP — we will need thousands in this city over the next few weeks. We’re getting them as fast as we can but we could use your help!    We’re reaching out to you directly. — Mayor Bill de Blasio (@NYCMayor) March 19, 2020  Musk isn’t the first to propose using his company’s manufacturing facilities to make critical equipment. Just yesterday, General Motors said CEO Mary Barra told the White House she was looking into making ventilators at her company’s factories. Ford followed suit soon after. Musk is alone among those peers in underplaying the pandemic, though. He called the “panic” over the coronavirus “dumb,” compared the lethality of COVID-19 to car crashes (which are not contagious), and finished his Twitter conversation about ventilators on Wednesday night by again saying he thinks the “panic will cause more harm than the virus, if that hasn’t happened already.”  As for how Musk might approach making ventilators, the entrepreneur said they are “not difficult” to make. He pointed to how Tesla makes “cars with sophisticated hvac systems,” and SpaceX “makes spacecraft with life support systems,” though he admitted it would take some time to spin up any real production effort. Where they would be built is another question; Tesla is currently locked in a back-and-forth with local authorities in the San Francisco Bay Area over whether the company should suspend production of electric cars amid a shelter-in-place order, and it could run into a similar issue at its Gigafactory in Nevada now that the state has issued a similar directive.  President Trump’s gutting of critical government offices, combined with his apparent refusal to take the threat of the novel coronavirus seriously in the early weeks, has left states and local governments overwhelmed in the fight against the pandemic. At the same time, Trump’s administration has leaned hard on the private sector to pick up the slack in ways that have repeatedly surprised those companies. He claimed Google was developing a nationwide screening website that will help people learn if and how they should get tested for COVID-19 and said retail companies would offer up parking lot space for testing sites — despite neither of those claims having been completely true before they were uttered aloud.  Still, companies are putting themselves into the mix. Amazon announced it will hire 100,000 workers worldwide and is bumping up its hourly pay to both help with a delivery crunch and provide jobs for people who are now out of work. Gaming company Razer has said it will help make masks, too.  Musk is no stranger to inserting himself into an international crisis. He famously spun up an effort at SpaceX in 2018 to create a submersible vessel to help rescue the soccer team trapped in a cave network in Thailand. If Musk really wants to help out this time around, it looks like he already has one taker in New York City. It almost certainly won’t be the last, either.

"Online music marketplace Bandcamp is waiving its revenue share on sales today in order to help musicians who are impacted by the novel coronavirus pandemic. The platform normally takes 15 percent of each digital sale and 10 percent of each merchandise purchase. The lifted fees will be in place until 12AM PT tonight.  While streaming music does eventually pay out some money to artists, it can take months and is often divvied up between a lot of parties. Buying music on Bandcamp is a way to quickly and more directly put money in a musician’s pocket, as there are often fewer middlemen and funds are deposited within 24–48 hours of a purchase. Bandcamp’s structure is also unique in that it allows for flexible payments. Artists set a minimum purchase price for music and physical goods, but people are welcome to add more on top when they buy as a tip or gift.  Bandcamp is used by hundreds of thousands of artists, more than 3,000 labels, and has an inventory of over 800,000 unique physical products. The platform says that fans have paid artists $470 million through the platform since it launched in 2007, with $10.2 million paid out in the last 30 days.  “For many artists, a single day of boosted sales can mean the difference between being able to pay rent or not,” says Bandcamp co-founder and CEO Ethan Diamond. “Still, we consider this just a starting point. Musicians will continue to feel the effects of lost touring income for many months to come.”  The Verge noted this yesterday in speaking with musicians looking to Twitch to recoup lost tour funds. A study by the Music Industry Research Association found that the average US musician overwhelmingly relies on live shows for income, and now many are contending with unexpected hardship as many have scrapped most tours in recent weeks due to the pandemic. “The more you can prove you can sell hard tickets, the more you’re worth when you’re booked,” musician Marc Rebillet told The Verge. “I’m sort of scrambling to find a way to keep being able to live the way I want to live.”  For artists, Bandcamp’s announcement also outlines other ways to make money on the platform, including releasing old demos or live recordings, setting up a subscription service, and listing things like video hangouts, lessons, and gear tutorials as merch items.  Additionally, Pitchfork has also listed over two dozen labels on Bandcamp that are directing a greater percentage from sales to their artists, including Hyperdub, Captured Tracks, and Citrus City.  With the announcement, Bandcamp’s website appears to be experiencing higher traffic than usual and intermittently going offline. Make sure to check back through the day if you’re met with an “we are offline briefly for maintenance” message.",1
"Share All sharing options for: Stay-at-home parenting in the time of coronavirus: mashed blueberries, diaper-less baseball  A yellowish-gray substance wrapped in a chilled tortilla with a side of mashed strawberries and blueberries arrived around noon on Monday.  “Surprise, Daddy! We brought you lunch,” said Matteo, my 2-year-old, beaming along with his older brother, Lucca, in the doorway to my makeshift home office.  My wife had given our children strict instructions not to disturb Daddy, and, mostly, they had complied. Sure, there were the occasional high-pitched shrieks and the wallop of what sounded like the armoire tipping over and slamming onto the ceiling above me — not to mention the “Ont some waffles!” cry from Matteo every couple of hours or so.  But after heapings of coronavirus gloom from the morning news, my children’s scrambled egg offering brought more comfort than a plate of my favorite spaghetti carbonara.  I’ve never worked from home before. I’m on Day 3 and can’t imagine this isolation lasting for another two, three, four — goodness knows how many more weeks.  But we can’t really shut out the outside world. Beside the barrage of bad news — including mounting coronavirus cases in Italy, my father’s home — my wife and I worry that Matteo, who is asthmatic, might need a trip to the emergency room, as he has a dozen or so times since his birth. I’m not a particularly religious man, but I’ve prayed about that in recent days.  But like everyone else, we are adjusting to this new reality.  I’m struck by how quiet it is in the mornings — before my children awaken. Quiet enough to hear chattering sparrows and the bird song that cuts through all of that, the whit-choo, whit-choo, whit-choo! of the northern Cardinal. Signs, too, that spring is not so far off.  This morning, we were greeted by the smiling, bearded face of “Mr. Muhammad,” Matteo’s Montessori music teacher, who could be seen on my phone strumming his guitar all alone in the school’s music room. Typically, he’s accompanied by a dozen or so bouncing toddlers, including Matteo. The day before, he’d offered a yoga class as a way to help all of us to calm down a little bit.  “Can I listen to Mr. Hammad?” Matteo said, noticing the video on my phone.  Then, not fully grasping the reality of the situation, he said, “Where’s Matteo? Where’s Logan?”  Mr. Muhammad is nothing short of a rock star in our family — a guy who will only become more revered as this thing drags on.  It’s been harder to gauge how Lucca, my 8-year-old, is doing. Not long ago, he declared, “Children are dying from the coronavirus.”  He has stopped talking about the disease in recent days. And when I sat him down and asked if he’s still worried, he assured me that he isn’t.  But it’s hard to say what’s going on in that Pokemon-obsessed head of his. At times, he’s refused to sleep in the bunk bed he’d begged us for months to buy. The other day, I found him curled up asleep on the floor in his bedroom. And Lucca, like Matteo, is more insistent than ever that I read him a bedtime story every night.  On Tuesday, Lucca brought me “lunch” — two pieces of bread that appeared to have leaped out of the toaster in fear of being browned. Lucca had smeared peanut butter on one slice and made a strawberry jam smiley face on the other.  To cool the cabin fever, I announced we were going to have a backyard baseball game on my lunch break — never mind that Dad, who grew up in England, doesn’t actually know the rules of baseball. About 10 minutes later, Matteo arrived at my office door in a shirt and, from the waist down, nothing but his birthday suit.  “I want to go out and play baseball!” he shouted.  His mother, with one arched eyebrow, followed close behind holding a diaper and questioning the timing of my announcement.  “Daddy shouldn’t have brought it up now,” she said.  So we are all adjusting. What choice do we have?

"With applications by state residents for unemployment insurance surging, the Illinois Department of Employment Security has announced emergency rules for those who can qualify for benefits during the coronavirus pandemic.  The giant coronavirus stimulus legislation signed into law Friday provides federal money for the state to provide extra and extended unemployment benefits.  The Department of Employment Security has not yet revised its website to reflect how newly eligible people can apply for the new federally funded assistance, with state officials still working out the details.  Gov. J.B. Pritzker said at a briefing Saturday a “deluge” of applications for unemployment continue to flood the department.  Under the new federal law, funding will flow to states to help cover gig workers newly eligible for unemployment compensation; 13 weeks of extra payments will be added to the 26 already allowed and, according to Section 2104 of the legislation, there will also be an “emergency increase in unemployment compensation” of “an additional $600 per week payment to each recipient of unemployment insurance or Pandemic Unemployment Assistance for up to four months. “  Tens of thousands of workers across Illinois have been temporarily out of work since the outbreak began forcing businesses to close. Last week, Pritzker ordered all bars and restaurants to stop serving dine-in customers, and on Saturday, he issued a stay-at-home order leaving just “essential” businesses in operation.  Related Frustration mounts as state scrambles to keep up with jobless benefits claims  A message to our readers We’re keeping essential coronavirus news that you need to know accessible for free here at suntimes.com. This public service is yet another example of the importance of quality local journalism, so please consider supporting us through a digital subscription. Subscribe  The result is countless people are now out of work and being forced into the state’s unemployment system. Illinois alone saw more than 64,000 new claims for unemployment benefits from March 16-18, and an unprecedented 130,000-plus claims so far this month, officials said.  To handle this massive influx of new applications, IDES announced it recently adopted emergency rules for who qualifies for unemployment insurance.  Unemployment insurance (UI) basics  In normal times, UI provides temporary income via federal funds to Illinois residents who are unemployed but able, available and actively seeking work each week.  The amount residents can receive depends on their usual pay rate with benefits ranging from $51 to $580 per week. Those approved can receive up to 26 weeks of benefits in a 12-month period.  The new emergency rules adopted during the coronavirus pandemic open up UI to a much larger group of workers. This means many people who wouldn’t typically qualify for UI can get benefits during the state of emergency.  Additionally, under the federal relief bill passed last week, Illinois residents receiving unemployment benefits will receive an additional $600 weekly above what they would receive in regular unemployment benefits until July 31, 2020.  Workers temporarily laid off due to COVID-19 can get UI  Illinois residents who are temporarily out of work because their employer has closed due to the coronavirus can qualify for UI if they meet all the other basic requirements.  The state isn’t expecting anyone to go out looking for a new job during a stay-at-home order: as long as applicants are prepared to return to their job as soon as the employer reopens, they’ll be considered to be actively seeking work and will qualify.  Under emergency rules, these workers will not have to register with the employment service.  Workers who quit due to COVID-19 fears cannot get UI  Unlike Illinois residents who are temporarily laid off by their employers’ closure, workers who voluntarily leave their job over concerns of the coronavirus will not be eligible for UI. The agency says “an individual generally has a duty to make a reasonable effort to work with his or her employer to resolve whatever issues have caused the individual to consider quitting.”  Parents who leave work due to a child’s school closure can get UI  With all Illinois schools closed through at least the end of April, and possibly the remainder of the school year, parents who voluntarily leave work to care for their child can qualify for UI because they “could be considered as unemployed through no fault of” their own.  You must still meet all of the other standard requirements, and unlike workers temporarily laid off due to COVID-19, parents who voluntarily leave work must be registered with the employment service.  Anyone who’s already exhausted UI rights may be eligible for additional benefits  With the passing of the federal relief bill in Congress last week, IDES announced Tuesday that some individuals who have already received their full 26 weeks of regular unemployment benefits in the last one-year period will be eligible for additional benefits during the crisis.  “If you have exhausted your benefits, or you are close to exhausting your benefits, we are finalizing the process to continue benefits under the stimulus package,” IDES said in a Q-and-A posted on its website. The agency says more information will be issued once guidance is provided by the U.S. Department of Labor.  Here’s how to apply for UI  You can call the Illinois Department of Economic Services at (800) 244-5631 or 866-488-4016 (TTY), but users are urged to file claims via the IDES website. And do not go in person: as of March 19, IDES offices are closed to the public until further notice.  To accommodate the massive surge of applicants, the agency has staggered times for people to submit claims:  People whose last names start with the letters A through M are asked to file claims online on Sundays, Tuesdays or Thursdays.  Last names beginning with N through Z should file claims on Mondays, Wednesdays or Fridays.  Saturdays are set aside for people who aren’t able to file during their allotted time, officials said.  People without internet access should call in according to the following schedule, per IDES:",1
"Afro-Funk Saxophonist Manu Dibango Dies Of COVID-19  Enlarge this image toggle caption Ullstein Bild/Getty Images Ullstein Bild/Getty Images  One of the pioneers of Afro-funk music, the saxophonist Manu Dibango, has died of COVID-19. He was 86 years old, and died in Paris. Internationally, he was best known for his 1972 song ""Soul Makossa,"" though his entire oeuvre could have been the soundtrack to a cooler 1970s than most people lived. But that one, funk-drenched hit, lit by Dibango's burning saxophone, went on to influence the sound of American disco — and its hooky spoken intro helped power songs by Michael Jackson and Rihanna.  Dibango's death was announced on social media by his representatives, who said that he died Tuesday at age 86 due to the coronavirus; they had also announced last Wednesday that he had been hospitalized due to the pandemic. A public memorial will be ""organized when possible,"" the announcement said.  YouTube  ""Soul Makossa"" became a hit in New York after DJ David Mancuso started playing the track at his Loft parties.  Dibango was born December 12, 1933, in the port city of Douala, Cameroon; his father was a civil servant. His parents' marriage was unusual for the time: His mother came from the Douala ethnic group, and his father from the Yabassi, and he later said that he never felt quite at home identifying with either.  When he was 15 years old, his parents sent him to study in France, so that he could return as an administrator, like his father. He paid for his initial rent in Europe with three kilograms of coffee from home — a fact that provided the title for his autobiography. He had been sent abroad to study philosophy, but instead fell in love with American jazz. As he told WHYY's Fresh Air in 1990, his parents were extremely upset by his decision to pursue music professionally, and cut him off.  While still in France, he began playing in bands — piano, mandolin, vibraphone and, soon enough, saxophone. Dibango made his way to Brussels, where he met one of Africa's greatest bandleaders, Joseph ""Grand Kallé"" Kabasele, a master of Congolese rumba. This was a time of exciting, super-danceable musical experimentation -- Congolese rumba was a blend of American jazz, Cuban rhythms and buoyant African sounds. The genre-bending, free-wheeling music became part of the roots of Dibango's own creativity as a bandleader.  Kabasele hired Dibango to play saxophone in his group, African Jazz. As part of that group, Dibango traveled to what was then Congo, now Zaire, to spend a month with the band. Instead, he stayed two years and opened his own club, Tam-Tam, in what was then the city of Léopoldville, now Kinshasa.  Dibango then moved to France where, in the late 1960s and early '70s, he began to forge a career as a significant solo artist. But ""Soul Makossa"" skyrocketed him to international fame.  In the years after the success of ""Soul Makossa,"" he collaborated with many famed international artists, including Art Blakey, Herbie Hancock, Don Cherry, Sly and Robbie, Paul Simon, Peter Gabriel, King Sunny Adé, Youssou N'Dour, Hugh Masekela and Fela Kuti.  ""Soul Makossa"" was originally the B-side for a Dibango 45 RPM single; its refrain was something of a branding exercise for ""makossa,"" the funky, jazz-tinged dance genre that Dibango pioneered. (Kossa means ""dance"" in Douala, his mother's native language.)  In 1982, Michael Jackson picked up a version of a line that Dibango declaimed on ""Soul Makossa"" — which Jackson sang as ""mama-se, mama-sa, ma-makossa"" — on his song ""Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' "" from the album Thriller.  The Cameroonian musician sued the American megastar; Jackson settled out of court for an undisclosed amount of money. In 2007, Rihanna sampled Jackson's version of the ""Soul Makossa"" line on her song ""Don't Stop the Music."" (Jackson had given her permission, but not Dibango.) Two years later, Dibango sued Jackson again, as well as Rihanna in France; that time, his case failed, due to the earlier settlement.  Publicly, Dibango did not dwell on his wranglings with Jackson; as he wryly told Fresh Air in 1990, ""I think he wanted to say hello to Africa somewhere.",1
"New York State’s largest hospital system is giving high dose intravenous vitamin C treatments to COVID-19 patients based on reports from China of the approach helping patients there, according to the Post.  Pulmonologist and critical care specialists Dr. Andrew G. Weber, who is affiliated with two Northwell Health facilities on Long Island, is reporting that his COVID-19 intensive care patients are immediately receiving 1,500 mgs of vitamin C intravenously and are re-administered the exact amounts 3-4 times per day.  Each dose is more than 16 times the national recommended guideline allowances of 90 mg for adult men and 75 mg for adult women. This approach is based on experimental treatments and small studies involving coronavirus patients in Shanghai, China; a hospital even made a release about it.  The official statement from Xi’an Jiaotong University Second Hospital reads:  “On the afternoon of February 20, 2020, another 4 patients with severe new coronaviral pneumonia recovered from the C10 West Ward of Tongji Hospital. In the past 8 patients have been discharged from hospital. . . [H]igh-dose vitamin C achieved good results in clinical applications. We believe that for patients with severe neonatal pneumonia and critically ill patients, vitamin C treatment should be initiated as soon as possible after admission. . .[E]arly application of large doses of vitamin C can have a strong antioxidant effect, reduce inflammatory responses, and improve endothelial function. . . Numerous studies have shown that the dose of vitamin C has a lot to do with the effect of treatment. . . [H]gh-dose vitamin C can not only improve antiviral levels, but more importantly, can prevent and treat acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress (ARDS).”  “The patients who received vitamin C did significantly better than those who did not get vitamin C,” said Weber. “It helps a tremendous amount, but it is not highlighted because it’s not a sexy drug.”  Jason Molinet who is spokesperson for Northwell states that vitamin C is being “widely used” to treat COVID-19 patients throughout the system, but the treatment protocols vary from patient to patient “as the clinician decides.” Currently about 700 patients are being treated across the hospital network, but Molient was not sure exactly how many were getting vitamin C treatments.  The vitamin C treatments are being administered in addition to other medicines such as hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and various other biologicals and blood thinners, according to Weber. New York hospitals have been given federal permission to administer a cocktail of azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine to desperately ill patients on a compassionate care basis.  Vitamin C levels dramatically drop in those with COVID-19 when they experience sepsis, which is an inflammatory response that happens when the body overreacts to the infection. “It makes all the sense in the world to try and maintain this level of vitamin C,” says Weber.  Zhongnan Hospital in Wuhan, China is conducting clinical trials on the effectiveness of high dose intravenous vitamin C on COVID-19 patients. One is a randomized triple blind study involving 140 COVID-19 patients, and it is expected to be complete by September, 30, 2020 based on information posted in the National Library of Medicine’s website.  The small French study published last week using the cocktail combination of hydroxychloroquine/Plaquenil and azithromycin/Zithromax showed that 5 out of 6 COVID-19 patients that were treated with the cocktail tested negative on day 3 and all tested negative on day 6. However, Dr. Anthony Fauci who is the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infection Diseases cautions that this cocktail has not been proven in clinical trials.",0

Blum made his Broadway debut in 1977’s “The Merchant” and appeared in works ranging from “Lost in Yonkers” to both revivals of Gore Vidal’s “The Best Man.”  His last appearance on the Great White Way was in 2013’s “The Assembled Parties.”  An actor to the end, his last off-Broadway appearance was in September’s “Fern Hill.”  On the silver screen, he was known for “Crocodile Dundee,” “Desperately Seeking Susan” and “Shattered Glass,” and was a staple on television, including a recent role in the thriller “You” as bookshop owner Mr. Moody. He also was featured on “Fraiser,” Hulu’s ”Mozart in the Jungle” and HBO’s “The Sopranos,” among many others.  Outpourings of love peppered social media Thursday morning as news of Blum’s death spread.  Playwrights Horizons announced his death on Twitter, saying, “With love and heavy hearts, Playwrights Horizons pays tribute to Mark Blum, a dear longtime friend and a consummate artist who passed this week. Thank you, Mark, for all you brought to our theater, and to theaters and audiences across the world. We will miss you.”  Damon’s tribute to Blum continued: “Mark was a dedicated Screen Actors Guild and SAG-AFTRA board member serving from 2007-2013, a passionate champion for merger, and a tireless advocate for members. Those of us lucky enough to have known him will treasure our memories of a gifted actor, a master teacher, a loyal friend and a beautiful human.  “On a personal note — I always appreciated Mark’s clear perception of complex situations. He always spoke the truth and did a great service in informing members of our community about the ins and outs of the union whenever he had the opportunity.  “Mark was smart, funny, and a true actor’s actor. He will be deeply missed. Thinking of you all. Please #stayhome. #COVID19”  Actress Judith Light tweeted, “Mark Blum, so generous, so kind, so humble, so talented. Our time together in the play ‘The Assembled Parties’ at MTC was a true joy. May he rest in peace knowing that he transformed the lives of so many and was cherished by so many; me among them.”  Actor Josh Radnor said, “When I was in drama school Mark Blum was exactly the kind of actor I aspired to be: constantly employed, deeply respected, total mensch. Gutted to hear of his passing. His wife Janet Zarish was my acting teacher at NYU. They were the loveliest couple. My heart breaks for her.”  Playwright Heidi Schreck wrote, “Oh this is devastating. The brilliant and generous Mark Blum was such a life giving force in New York theater. We will miss you dearly.”  Read more at usatoday.com",1
"Atlanta United President Darren Eales says Major League Soccer still intends to play a full 34-game schedule this season, even though the league will be shuttered for at least two months because of the new coronavirus.  Eales says MLS is more fortunate than other leagues around the world that play the traditional fall-to-spring schedule and may have trouble completing their seasons in such a compressed time frame.  MLS was just two weeks into its season when play was halted March 12 because of the pandemic. The league has set a tentative return date of May 10, though the growing death toll in the United States could force that date to be pushed back.  Eales says everything is on the table, including the possibility of resuming league play in empty stadiums.  “We’re fortunate that we had just started our season,” he said Monday during a teleconference with Atlanta media. “We have the whole calendar year to reschedule the games we missed. The emphasis is on playing all 34 games plus the playoffs.”  MLS will likely schedule more midweek games and push back its MLS Cup championship game into mid-December in a bid to play a full season, according to Eales. He added that the playoffs could begin in mid-November — around the time MLS had been planning its title game.",1
"SPRINGFIELD — Corruption busting is the latest casualty of the coronavirus in Illinois.  Illinois House Majority Leader Greg Harris, D-Chicago, and state Sen. Elgie Sims, D-Chicago, chairs of the Joint Commission on Ethics and Lobbying Reform, said Tuesday that the pandemic has forced them to miss a deadline in their efforts.  The commission was required to release a report by Tuesday with recommendations on how to end entrenched corruption in Illinois, but as the COVID-19 crisis has temporarily shut down sessions of the General Assembly, it has also stymied the work of the commission.  “We have completed our meetings, heard from stakeholders and are working through the proposals that have been put before us,” the two Chicago Democrats said in a joint statement. “However, due to the ongoing crisis, more time will be necessary to complete our work.”  The commission, established by the Legislature in November, is tasked with proposing ways to reform state government in the wake of scandals that have rocked state, county and municipal government. Harris and Sims said they still hope to pass ethics reform legislation in the spring legislative session, which is scheduled to adjourn May 31. But since lawmakers have not met since March 5 – and Gov. J.B. Pritzker on Tuesday extended the state’s stay-at-home order until April 30 — that could become increasingly difficult.  Before the pandemic altered the landscape, Pritzker declared that ending corruption was a priority. In his State of the State speech in January, the governor said the state must “root out the purveyors of greed and corruption — in both parties — whose presence infects the bloodstream of government.”  A wide-ranging federal investigation targeting state lawmakers and other politicians prompted the latest push.  In September, federal officials raided the offices of state Sen. Martin Sandoval. The Southwest Side Democrat pleaded guilty to corruption charges in January.  In October, state Rep. Luis Arroyo was charged with bribery. The former Northwest Side Democratic legislator’s case is still ongoing. Earlier last year, state Sen. Tom Cullerton, D-Villa Park, was indicted in August for allegedly embezzling money from the Teamsters.  While Republican lawmakers wanted to tackle corruption in the fall veto session last November, Democrats opted to form the commission to study the issue first and to release a report on what reforms are needed.",1

"With grocery stores being one of the few places still open during COVID-19 lockdowns, disposable plastic bags are making a comeback as some people fear that reusable bags could spread the disease. Before the pandemic, a growing number of governments banned single-use plastic bags in an effort to cut down on waste. But as the novel coronavirus has spread around the globe, people have gotten leery about coming in close contact with other people and their possessions, including reusable bags. On March 31st, New Hampshire became the first state in the US to temporarily ban reusable bags during the pandemic.  “For whatever reason, people seem to get very fired up about grocery bags,” says Meghan May, a professor of microbiology and infectious disease at the University of New England College of Osteopathic Medicine. “Ordinarily I use [reusable bags] all the time because I live in a beach town and a clean ocean is really important,” May tells The Verge. But now she and many others are thinking twice.  There has been no evidence of reusable bags spreading the novel coronavirus  Like pretty much everything else right now, reusable bags should probably be handled more carefully to minimize the risk of transmitting disease to other people. At the same time, there has been no evidence so far that using reusable grocery bags have been responsible for spreading the novel coronavirus.  We don’t really know how long the novel coronavirus can persist on reusable bags. The best data experts have is from one study that found that the virus could stay viable on plastic for up to three days in lab conditions. (That means shoppers may want to be careful when handling disposable plastic bags, too, environmental advocates contend.) That research didn’t look into how the virus fares on fabric, so we can’t apply its findings directly to cloth bags, according to May.  Shoppers should still take precautions with reusable bags, despite the lack of data, May advises. “One would want to err on the side of caution here because we know [the virus] can survive on many different types of surfaces,” she says. “We should probably assume that it can be transmitted that way until someone demonstrates that it can’t.”  “Err on the side of caution.”  One way to stop the spread of germs is to wash reusable bags before and after each use. (That’s in addition to washing your hands before and after you go to the store, avoiding touching your face, wiping down baskets and carts, and bagging your own items.) Plastic and nylon bags can be cleaned with soap and water, then sprayed or wiped down with a diluted bleach solution or disinfectant, according to recommendations from North Carolina State University. Make sure to clean both the inside and outside of the bag and let them air dry before storing or using them, the university adds, and cloth bags can be washed like laundry, then they should be dried on the warmest setting.  But the virus could transfer quickly from one person to an item they’ve been in close contact with, like a bag, reusable or otherwise, May points out. If an infected person hands the bag to someone else, they risk passing along the virus. The person who faces the most risk, according to May, is the grocery store worker interacting with many customers throughout his or her shift. “They have to touch [the reusable bag], handle it and pack things into it, and then they have to then turn around and do that with the next customer that comes in their line,” May says. “The person at least risk is the person who owns the bag.”  That’s why some grocery stores and states are turning back to disposable bags: they simply aren’t handled quite as much, so there’s less uncertainty over where they’ve been.  But protecting public health doesn’t have to be at odds with efforts to stem the flood of plastics filling landfills and collecting in the ocean, environmental advocates say. “If stores, particularly workers, want to keep themselves as safe as possible and limit the bags coming in because they don’t know if people wash them, certainly a temporary pause on that, I think that’s understandable,” Ivy Schlegel, a senior research specialist for Greenpeace USA, says. But that “pause” shouldn’t be permanent, says Schlegel. She has followed the plastics industry’s history of fighting environmental reforms by claiming that reusable bags are unsanitary. She sees the industry seizing the opportunity now to push its own agenda.  A frequently cited 2011 study that found bacteria in seldom-washed reusable bags was actually underwritten by a fossil fuel and chemical industry group, the American Chemistry Council. It was cited in a March 18th letter that the Plastics Industry Association penned to the Department of Health and Human Services asking that the department “speak out against bans on [single-use plastic] products as a public safety risk.”  “Some people will call it disaster capitalism.”  “Some people will call it disaster capitalism,” says Schlegel. “Using this moment where everything is in chaos and people are legitimately concerned about public health to turn back the clock to go back to a world where plastic is the norm, rather than right now where reusables are becoming the norm in many places.”  The plastic pollution problem isn’t going away anytime soon. A plastic grocery bag adrift in the ocean can take up to 20 years to decompose. A plastic bottle could stick around for up to 450 years, according to estimates from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Less than 10 percent of all plastics have actually been recycled. The industry knew all along that recycling wouldn’t solve the environmental harms posed by plastic, but it continued to promote it as a viable solution anyway, according to a joint investigation by PBS Frontline and NPR published this week.  There are ways to limit plastic waste during the COVID-19 pandemic. May recommends simply carrying groceries straight from the basket or cart to your car if that’s possible. Paper bags are another alternative; they are still single-use, but at least they’re compostable. And Schlegel tells The Verge that one way to make reusable bags cleaner and more convenient in the future could be to implement municipal programs that pick up residents’ reusable bags, sanitize them, and then return them to stores for reuse. Those solutions might not be available everywhere during this pandemic, but they’re worth thinking about as we prepare for what comes next. In the long run, protecting public health and the planet usually go hand in hand.",1
"Three Blue Origin employees have now tested positive for COVID-19 in Washington, according to emails from the company seen by The Verge. The cases, first reported by CNBC and GeekWire, were just announced over the weekend, days after Blue Origin management pressured employees to conduct an upcoming test launch of the company’s New Shepard rocket during a meeting.  “Over the weekend, we unfortunately had two more Blue Origin employees test positive for the COVID-19 virus,” Mary Plunkett, the senior director of organizational development at Blue Origin, wrote in an email, referencing another employee who had been confirmed on Friday. The two new confirmed cases are a married couple who work at Blue Origin’s headquarters in Kent, Washington. One was last in the office as early as Friday, April 3rd, while the other had last been in the office on March 27th, according to an email sent to employees on Sunday.  “Over the weekend, we unfortunately had two more Blue Origin employees test positive.”  Blue Origin says its human resources team will keep in contact with the employees, and the company has conducted a “thorough deep cleaning” of the places visited by the individuals. The company stressed to employees that they should stay home if they are sick. An email sent out on Friday told employees: “As a reminder, public health officials and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) consider being in the same indoor environment, such as a conference room or factory, as a person with a confirmed case of COVID-19 as being a low risk for infection.”  The news of the cases comes after The Verge revealed that employees at Blue Origin have raised concerns about conducting a test launch of the company’s New Shepard rocket, designed to take paying customers to the edge of space and back. Conducting the test would require transporting employees from Washington to rural Texas. In a meeting with employees, Blue Origin management suggested that there might be employment repercussions if people didn’t travel for the launch. In response to The Verge’s report, Blue Origin CEO Bob Smith told employees in an email that the company would, in fact, be hiring amid the pandemic and not conducting layoffs.",1
"When I heard that a tiger at the Bronx Zoo tested positive for COVID-19, I started to worry about my own little lion, a tabby cat with asthma. I’ve sequestered myself away from friends and family, but could my company be unwittingly putting my cat at risk? While there have been some cases of animals contracting COVID-19, it’s rare — and there are precautions that pet owners can take if they’re worried about their furry family members.  Coronaviruses are zoonotic, which means that they can be passed between animals and humans. In New York City, the virus apparently jumped from an asymptomatic human to three lions and four tigers, including four-year-old tiger Nadia, that tested positive for the virus. The zoo says it expects all of the animals to make full recoveries.  Scientists still don’t know for sure what type of animal first passed the new virus to a person. A wet market, where animals, seafood, and produce are sold, in China was thought to be where the novel coronavirus first made the jump. But a January study found the first person known to get sick from the virus didn’t have contact with the market. Another study found that the genome sequence of the novel coronavirus infecting people was a 99 percent genetic match with one found in pangolins, one of the most trafficked mammals in Asia, according to the World Wildlife Fund. The pangolins might have been an intermediary carrying the virus from bats to humans. Another analysis found that the genome sequence of the novel coronavirus is 96 percent identical to a coronavirus found in bats, which have been identified as the origin of both SARS and MERS.  There has been no evidence of a pet anywhere in the world transmitting COVID-19 to a person.  Even though the virus kicked off a pandemic by being passed from one species to another, it’s not often that coronaviruses make this kind of interspecies jump and continue spreading, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There has been no evidence of a pet anywhere in the world transmitting COVID-19 to a person, according to the World Health Organization. The outbreaks happening now are the result of people passing the virus to one another. Despite that, some animal advocacy groups are worried that misguided fear of COVID-19 patients’ pets could lead to more animals abandoned and mistreated.  There have been a few cases of domestic cats and dogs testing positive for the virus after their owners became sick with COVID-19. A 17-year-old Pomeranian in Hong Kong tested “weakly positive” in February and died in March, but the dog might have simply died of old age, according to reporting from the South China Morning Post. A two-year-old German shepherd in Hong Kong tested positive after its owner came down with the disease, while another dog that lived in the same home didn’t. A cat in Hong Kong and another cat in Belgium have also tested positive. The cat in Belgium “showed clinical signs of digestive and respiratory disease,” according to information from the National Veterinary Services of Belgium.  Cats might be more susceptible to COVID-19 than dogs, according to one study conducted in China that hasn’t yet been peer-reviewed. Domestic cats that had been infected with the virus by introducing samples of it through their noses were placed in kennels next to cats that were not infected. The researchers later found that one of the previously healthy cats caught the virus after being near the infected felines, most likely through respiratory droplets — the same way humans can spread the virus through coughing and sneezing. Dogs in the study, on the other hand, seemed to be more resistant to the virus and did not pass it to one another. There was no evidence that the cats shed enough of the virus to give it to people.  Those results should be taken with a grain of salt since it was a small study of animals given high doses of the virus. They don’t “represent real-life interactions between people and their pets,” virologist Linda Saif at Ohio State University in Wooster told Nature.  If you develop COVID-19, the CDC recommends avoiding cuddles, kisses, and sharing food.  If you develop COVID-19, the CDC recommends avoiding cuddles, kisses, sharing food, and having other close contact with your pet to avoid passing the disease on to them. Ask someone else in your household to take care of your pet if that’s possible, and wash your hands before and after touching your pet if it’s a service animal or if you do have to care for it while you’re sick. The same guidelines apply if you think you might be sick but haven’t been tested or are waiting for results. Wearing a mask around your pet is also appropriate if you’re ill, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association.  Because the novel coronavirus can survive for some time on different surfaces, there is a slight chance that our furry friends could carry the virus even though they’re not infected. But the only study to date of how long the virus can persist on surfaces looked at plastic, metal, and cardboard — not animal fur. It’s usually harder for a virus to survive and spread to another person via a porous surface, like hair or fur, because it’s more likely to get trapped in the pores of the material, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. The CDC points out that any animal can carry germs that might make a person sick, so whether there’s a pandemic or not, it’s a good idea to wash your hands after handling any animal, its food, or waste.  The bottom line is that we’ll probably need to take similar precautions with our pets as we do with our human loved ones. That means keeping a safe distance when necessary so that we can all stay healthy.",1

"Federal agencies charged with delivering aid and health guidelines related to the coronavirus are not translating their materials into languages other than English fast enough, according to a congressional letter sent to the White House on Friday.  The letter — co-written by Reps. Jesus “Chuy” Garcia, D-Ill., and Donna Shalala, D-Fla., and co-sponsored by more than 60 other members of Congress — calls on the Trump administration and more than a dozen federal agencies to immediately provide all relevant materials on the pandemic in Spanish and other languages.  “As a matter of public health and safety for all, English-language proficiency should not serve as a barrier to obtain or distribute vital information from the federal government,” the letter reads. “Failing to immediately provide guidance in Spanish and other languages will jeopardize the health, safety, and economic stability of millions across this country.”  Agencies named in the letter include the White House Coronavirus Task Force, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Small Business Administration and the IRS.  A White House representative could not be reached for comment.  Census figures show more than 65 million people in the United States speak a language other than English at home. About 25 million people in the country did not speak English proficiently in 2015, according to the Migration Policy Institute.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides a version of its website in Spanish and “simplified” Chinese. It has also translated information about the coronavirus into dozens of languages during the past couple of weeks.  The White House was criticized in late March for not providing a translated version of guidelines asking Americans to stay at home and avoid crowds of 10 or more people until it was pressured to do so by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.",1
"Three immigrants and a correctional officer at a downstate county jail used by Immigration and Customs Enforcement have tested positive for the coronavirus.  The Pulaski County Detention Center is one of three county jails in Illinois contracted by ICE to hold suspected undocumented immigrants. The three immigrants held at Pulaski are the first ICE detainees in Illinois to test positive for the virus that causes COVID-19.  Damon Acuff, warden at the Pulaski County jail, told the Southern Illinoisan that 130 of the 145 people held at the facility are ICE detainees.  Acuff and Pulaski County Sheriff Randy Kern could not be reached for comment.  On Friday, ICE said the men who tested positive were a 26-year-old Guatemalan, a 33-year-old Honduran and a 32-year-old Mexican.  The Chicago-based National Immigrant Justice Center is working with Sidley Austin LLP to file federal lawsuits to demand the release of medically vulnerable immigrants detained in Pulaski County.  There are nearly 34,000 immigrants detained by ICE across the country. Nearly two-thirds of them have never been convicted of a crime, according to a recent analysis of detainee records by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University.  ICE says 61 detainees and 19 detention center employees have tested positive for the coronavirus. Immigrant rights groups have warned about the potential rapid spread of the coronavirus in detention centers.  Lee Vanderlinden, an NIJC staff attorney, said they’re worried about their clients being at risk of contracting the virus at Pulaski County.  “The pods are set up where detainees are all living in an open area with bunk beds or in cells [and] share common areas where everyone eats. It’s impossible to keep six feet distance apart,” they said.  Lupe Perez, another NIJC attorney, said her client at the detention center is worried he’s defenseless against the virus.  Detainees “are not provided soap,” she said, “and they have to use the little money they have in commissary to buy soap, which means they can’t afford to talk to family.”  Earlier this week, the NIJC and Sidley Austin filed lawsuits on behalf of three people detained at the Jerome Combs Detention Center in Kankakee seeking their release.  Two of those immigrants, one of whom is a 46-year-old man who’s lived in Illinois for 30 years, were released Friday. The third has a hearing scheduled over the weekend.

"Ramesh Raskar has a plan with a reasonable chance of controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. Everyone in Illinois can help make it happen. But Gov. J.B. Pritzker needs to make a call first.  Raskar, a former Google and Facebook technologist who holds nearly 100 patents, heads a team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that has developed a digital contact tracing app called PrivateKit: SafePaths. It’s available free from the iPhone and Android app stores.  Contact tracing is essential to stopping COVID-19. It’s one of what Pritzker calls the “three T’s” — testing, tracing and treatment. The head of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says we need to do it.  Traditional contact tracing is slow and tedious. When someone tests positive for a dangerous virus, you find out everyone they’ve been in contact with for as long as they’ve been contagious — in COVID-19’s case, at least 14 days.  Then, you track down those people, test them, quarantine the infected ones and trace their contacts. Once everyone with the disease has been identified and isolated, the pandemic stops.  Traditional contact tracing is practical only in the early days of an outbreak, when few people have been infected. In most of the United States, we’re long past that point.  If everyone cooperates with the stay-at-home order, though, and the COVID-19 caseload drops, eventually contact tracing becomes doable again.  Just one problem. Researchers at Oxford University have found that because COVID-19 is transmitted so easily — many with the disease are contagious for a week before they show symptoms, and some never get symptoms at all — contact tracing has to be almost instantaneous to do any good. If it takes days, that’s too late.  Digital technology using smartphones makes instant contact tracing possible. As I previously wrote, China and South Korea successfully used it to control the pandemic.  But the technology can be intrusive. In China, people must have software installed on their phones that tracks their every move — useful when you’re trying to stamp out a pandemic but also handy for controlling the masses.  South Korea isn’t that bad, but the emergency alerts it beams out when someone tests positive for the coronavirus sometimes go into creepy detail about the patient’s travels — reportedly including an overnight excursion to a “love motel.”  The PrivateKit app that Raskar and his team have developed sidesteps such problems. It uses Bluetooth technology to record any close encounters you have with other PrivateKit users plus GPS location data to create a diary of your daily travels.  The diary is encrypted and lives only on your phone. If you test positive for COVID-19, you can — if you choose — turn your diary over to public health officials. They use software to scrub any details that identify you personally and load the result into a database.  Then they click on a button. An alert is sent instantly to every PrivateKit user with whom you came into contact in the past 14 days, telling them they could be at risk and providing instructions.  That’s it. No details about you.  Now suppose that before you tested positive you inadvertently came into contact with Jack, who hadn’t downloaded the PrivateKit app. The encounter wasn’t recorded in your diary, but your path was.  The day after you test positive, Jack downloads the app and has it check for COVID-19 contacts. The app searches the database, finds out Jack crossed paths with you and pops up an alert.  But wait, what if Jack never downloads the app or doesn’t even have a phone? If he comes down with COVID-19, how will health authorities know he got it from me?  They’ll figure it out the old-fashioned way with digital assistance. They’ll painstakingly ask Jack to recall his travels and load the information into the database. The software will do a search and, you’d hope, establish that Jack crossed paths with you.  It might not always work. But if mostly it does, and most COVID-19 carriers can be identified and isolated, the pandemic will peter out.  You’re thinking: This sounds like a long shot. Why bother?  Two reasons. One is to protect yourself. The other is to protect your family and friends.  At some point, stay-at-home restrictions will have to be eased, and people will start going back to work or school. Large gatherings will likely continue to be prohibited, but some semblance of normal activity must resume for the economy to start up again. And people will want to hang out, play sports, attend weddings, visit their elderly parents and generally get back to having a life.  Wouldn’t you want to protect those people? If you go to a party and later test positive for COVID-19, wouldn’t you want the attendees to know? If someone else at the party gets the disease, wouldn’t you want to be told?  That’s what PrivateKit does. If I go to any social gatherings or work meetings, I’ll want the app on my phone, and I’m not walking in unless everybody else has it, too.  Lots of people need to use the app to get the pandemic under control. Christophe Fraser, a co-author of the Oxford study, told me the adoption rate has be roughly 60%. Fat chance we’ll get the whole country to that level. It’ll be tough enough in Illinois.  So what? The app will help even if adoption is a lot less.  “Every life we save matters,” Raskar says. “I’d be happy to eliminate one case and prevent one elderly person from being exposed.”  None of this is possible without the support of local authorities. They need the software to enter the diaries of COVID-19 patients into the database, and medical personnel have to be trained in how to use it. An administrative infrastructure has to be set up to make the whole thing work.  A huge team isn’t needed. Raskar estimates it would take 300 people statewide, plus additional staff to do traditional contact tracing as a backup. He’s working with 20 jurisdictions around the country. He says Illinois could — and should — be the first to start.  Pritzker understands the importance of contact tracing. When I asked him at his briefing Thursday whether he was considering a contact tracing program, he responded enthusiastically.  Governor, please call Raskar and have him explain the technology and how it would be implemented. He’s got the best plan I’ve heard of for getting us past this nightmare.  Digital contact tracing worked in Asia. We can — and need — to do it here.  Send letters to letters@suntimes.com.",1
"Next week, more than 355,000 Chicago Public Schools students will begin remote learning. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced teachers, students and families to make quick adjustments into new daily roles and routines.  Some families may be undergoing such profound stress that students cannot do any schoolwork at all. For other students, schoolwork may provide some stability and a sense of purpose for their future.  The good news is that even when faced with major disruptions in learning, children are resilient and tend to catch up in skill development to where they would have been, as long as they enter a supportive environment after the disruption. Students who have a smaller gain in learning in one year tend to have a larger gain in the following year.  Opinion  As the district, teachers, and families figure out the strategies that work best for them, there are lessons from research conducted under normal conditions that may be helpful in this unique situation.  Countering the limitations of online Instruction  Research indicates that most students learn better when instruction is in person, rather than online, and students with the lowest achievement seem to benefit least from online classes. Even if online instruction isn’t as effective as face-to-face instruction, it is still effective for most students, and better than no instruction.  One reason students sometimes struggle with online learning is because of a lack of flexibility in what is taught. While online classes are usually self-paced, course content can feel rigid. In a study comparing online to face-to-face algebra credit recovery classes, researchers found that face-to-face teachers adjusted the content of their instruction considerably more than online teachers, even though the online teachers had the technology to be able to offer mini-tutorials and respond directly to students’ questions.  It was easier for the in-person teachers to recognize when students needed help and adapt their instruction accordingly. In fact, when students taking the algebra course online had access to a supportive math teacher in their computer lab, they ended up with similar pass rates as students enrolled in face-to-face versions of the same class.  All of this suggests that online learning places more demands on teachers around intentional communication with students and their caregivers.  Communication among teachers, students, and families is even more critical now  Another downside of online instruction is that it makes two-way communication more cumbersome. Teachers can’t anticipate how all their individual students will respond to instructional tasks, and the feedback they ordinarily get in the classroom as they watch and listen to students engage with the material is vital information for doing their jobs well.  Students feel supported when they believe their teacher knows how they are doing in the class and gives them the support they need to succeed. Without having students in front of them, teachers may not know when they are assigning work that is taking longer than it should to complete and when students feel stuck or overwhelmed. They also will have difficulty recognizing when students are under-challenged or disinterested.  It can be easier for people at home to see whether students need more support, whether work is taking too long, or if students feel under-challenged. To support learning at home, teachers and families need to be in regular communication, whether they have the technology for face-to-face online chats, or are reaching out by phone, group chats, texting, etc.  Even when assignments are not being used for grades, teachers can monitor assignment completion as a signal for who might need help, modifications, resources, or a more personal connection.  Learning is more than test scores — it’s also social and emotional  Brain science has shown that learning has both social and emotional components—people are not computers who can input information and retain it without making an emotional connection and seeing how it fits with their other experiences.  Teachers and caregivers who are supporting learning at home need to talk to students about how they are experiencing the work. Do students believe they can succeed at the task? Do they feel the work is relevant? Do they feel they will learn and grow from the experience?  Students’ confidence that they can succeed at their school assignments, and that the work has value, provides a sense of security and motivation.  What happens in the long-term will matter most  There is no clear roadmap for teachers, parents, and guardians right now. Nobody is going to be perfect in how they are able to support students, even as they all work very hard to do so. The crisis is causing acute immediate stress — from sharing confined space and home technology, to worry about severe financial and health effects on ourselves and others.  There will also be long-term stress from the financial fallout of the crisis and the loss of loved ones. Families will not have all the financial and emotional supports that they did previously, and inequities in education will become more extreme.  Supporting all students ultimately means making preparation so that students have a safe, stable school environment that is responsive to the social-emotional needs of every child when they go back to the classroom.

"Wolves defenseman Jaycob Megna and his wife, Kasey, recently had their first child, welcoming a new member to their family. It’s a stressful occasion even in the best circumstances, but Evie Marie arrived March 30 in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic.  ‘‘Once the baby is born, you’ve got another person that you’re in charge of that you need to protect,’’ Megna said. ‘‘It’s obviously not an ideal time with everything going on, but the one benefit is that I’ve been able to be around for everything. It’s been just over a week, and it’s been amazing.’’  Evie’s birth originally was scheduled for the Chicago area, but the suspension of the American Hockey League season and the league allowing players to leave their home markets afforded the Megnas an opportunity to switch plans. They chose to bring Evie into the world at Lehigh Valley Hospital in Allentown, Pennsylvania, near Kasey’s parents’ home.  The Megnas needed one day to reach Kasey’s parents’ home — where they’re currently staying — to prepare for the birth.  ‘‘It was definitely stressful,’’ Megna said. ‘‘Just getting here was a little stressful, just making sure nothing happened while we were driving, considering she was only two weeks from her due date when we were getting here. More so for my wife, it being our first kid, going through the whole process and being at a hospital, it is a bit overwhelming.’’  Once the Megnas got to the hospital for Evie’s birth, they weren’t there long. They were told Kasey normally would be in the hospital for three nights, but she and Evie spent only 36 hours there before going home. Once doctors saw they were healthy, they were allowed to depart early.  ‘‘It was definitely a bit of a different experience, I would assume, than most,’’ Megna said. ‘‘It was still amazing.’’  Other than medical staff, only one person was allowed to be in the delivery room. Masks were mandatory when visitors entered, and Megna couldn’t leave even for food or water.  ‘‘Everything you needed, you had to call and they would bring it to you,’’ Megna said. ‘‘Three days of that might’ve been a little much. We were lucky we were able to get out of there quickly and safely.’’  Though the circumstances might have been unorthodox, Megna said he has no complaints about the experience.  Kasey and Evie are doing well, and Megna expects his parents soon will be able to meet their new granddaughter. He praised the medical staff that cared for his family, and the AHL hiatus has allowed him to spend more time with his infant daughter and recovering wife.  If the season hadn’t been halted, Megna would have been able to be at Evie’s birth, but he would have missed out on many other moments he has witnessed.  ‘‘It’s been pretty special,’’ Megna said. ‘‘There’s a lot going on, but we’re staying home like we’re supposed to, and it’s been a big opportunity to get to see my daughter quite a bit. She’s already changing so much. Helping to take care of my wife in her recovery. She’s been a champ.’’",1
"Comments by Brian Shilhavy  Editor, Health Impact News  There has been a debate going on in healthcare for more than 100 years. It started in the 1800s when two competing points of view were put forward to explain disease, and the cause of disease.  French medical scientist Louis Pasteur wrote on the “germ theory” of disease, while his French contemporary, Antoine Béchamp promoted a theory of “terrain,” or sometimes referred to as the “cellular theory.”  The following chart highlights some of the differences between the two theories:  An objective, critical review of each theory can find some merit to each approach.  For example, Pasteur’s work on unseen germs led to a change in practice for surgeons of the day, and many credit the work of Scottish doctor Joseph Lister for starting the practice of requiring surgeons to wash and disinfect their hands prior to surgery. Hospital-induced infections such as sepsis dropped so dramatically, that the practice of sterilization spread to surgical equipment as well.  But as an overall model for disease and health, many feel that Pasteur’s germ theory of disease overstates things in a reductionist sort of way that misses much in disease treatment. Holistic doctors today who supplement their medical training based mostly on the germ theory of disease, tend to follow the work originally put forth by Béchamp that the “terrian,” more commonly referred to today as the body’s “immune system,” is much more important and effective in treating or curing disease.  The evidence to support this theory is that pathogens affect everyone differently, not the same. Even during some of the most deadly recorded “plagues” or “pandemics” in history, some people succumbed, while others did not. Usually those who survived far outnumber those who died, leading to the theory that the immune system is the key factor in not only fighting disease, but preventing it in the first place.  Of course today’s medical system is NOT focused on prevention by building up the body’s immune system, as there is no profit from that. Today’s multi-TRILLION dollar medical industry needs sick patients to treat to remain economically viable. Well patients don’t provide the same profit. See:  But just as Dr. Joseph Lister put into practice Pastuer’s theory of germs with great success in reducing hospital deaths, which might be great for preventing the deaths of patients already sick and is more of a “hygiene” protocol than a health protocol, so too many physicians today are putting into practice methods that more closely follow Béchamp’s theories by bolstering the body’s immune system with great success in treating disease.  One such doctor that we have featured many times here on Health Impact News, is Dr. David Brownstein from the Center For Holistic Medicine in Michigan.  Dr. Brownstein has just published a report where he is claiming that his clinic has treated 85 patients for COVID-19 and that none of them have died, and none of them had to be hospitalized. He has also video recorded some of their testimonies.  So what treatment protocols did Dr. Brownstein use for this kind of success rate?  85 COVID Patients at The Center for Holistic Medicine: Zero Hospitalizations and No Deaths  by Dr. Brownstein  At my office, the Center for Holistic Medicine (CHM), we have had 85 COVID patients. At this time, no one has been hospitalized, no one has been diagnosed with pneumonia, and there have been no deaths.  There are five practitioners at CHM: Drs. Brownstein, Ng, Nusbaum, Jenny Drummond, PA, and Taylor Easson, NP. Since the start of the COVID-19 crisis, I have been asking my partners how their COVID patients are doing.  As of this week, we have had 85 patients either diagnosed with COVID or suspected COVID. I am pleased to report that our patients are doing well with this illness. (Note, since new guidelines have come out stating that any suspected COVID patient can be diagnosed with COVID, I am lumping COVID and suspected COIVD patients together for this post.)  I first reported to you about COVID on January 26, 2020. That was the first time I presented our protocol of using vitamins A, C, D, and iodine not only to support the immune system but also to treat viral infections.  In that post, I also pointed out how important eating a healthy diet is. The importance of using intravenous nutrient therapy, especially vitamin C, was mentioned.  Finally, I suggested that, with coronavirus, it would be wise not to get a flu vaccine since the flu vaccine has been shown to significantly increase the risk of coronavirus and other flu-like viral infections.  That post seems like a lifetime ago even though it was only 10 weeks ago. During that time period, my message has not changed. In fact, after witnessing the results our patients have experienced, I am more convinced than ever that a holistic approach like I presented above should be the first-line treatment provided to any COVID patient.  The human body is a true wonder. Given the proper support, it can do wonders. And, when the body is healthy, it can withstand and overcome an infectious illness like COVID.  The initial conventional approach to COVID was to encourage people to wash their hands (a good thing). As things worsened, the only other conventional idea was to quarantine. When the disease spun out of control our Government and conventional medicine panicked. They had no real therapies to help COVID-suffering patients except for supportive care.  Thankfully, a few conventional therapies, like hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, have been promoted—though many in conventional medicine were downplaying it for far too long.  At my office, we were ready . The first 24 years of practicing holistic medicine was our time to figure out what worked and what did not work for people suffering from viral infections. That set us up to be ready for this pandemic.  In my blogs, I encouraged people to take high doses of vitamins A, C, D, and iodine at the first sign of an illness. In our practice, this was sufficient for the majority of our COVID patients. I (and my partners) have no doubt that the vast majority of COVID patients would avoid a deterioration of their symptoms if they started this protocol at the onset of symptoms.  However, some became more ill or did not start the oral supplements early enough into their illness. Those patients needed additional holistic therapies. These included nebulizing hydrogen peroxide and iodine along with intravenous nutrient therapies.  To protect our staff and healthy patients, we did not treat sick COVID patients inside my office. We were gowning up and meeting our patients at their automobile at the back of our building and administering IVs and ozone therapies. Some of these patients were very sick. So far, they all recovered. I have shared some of their stories via a skype interview on previous blog posts.  To watch a few of our patient testimonials go to:  There Is Still Hope Out There (3/28/20): Christopher  There Is Still Hope Out There (3/30/20): Jeremiah  There Is Still Hope Out There (4/05/20): Kendra  I think the end is in sight. We seem to be crossing over the hump of this dreadful disease. I have no doubt we will be in a much better position over the coming two weeks.  Folks, I hope the Powers-That-Be learn from this catastrophe. In the future, we need to focus on supporting the host rather than conventional medicine’s focus on killing the infectious organism. We do not have a vaccine or any other conventional therapy that is successful at destroying COVID.  In the future, I can guarantee you there will be other infectious illnesses that conventional medicine has no treatment to offer. Instead of waiting for the hail-Mary from conventional medicine, it is better to be prepared and have your body ready to fight back. This can be achieved by following my original instructions; eat a healthy diet, maintain optimal hydration, exercise, and correct nutrient imbalances with vitamin and mineral supplementation.  If you don’t have a holistic doctor, it is past time to find one. At my office, we are happy to see you or do a telemed appointment. If you are interested in this please email Ann Salomon at info@centerforholisticmedicine.com.  A holistic doctor can help you achieve your optimal health. Conventional doctors, on the other hand, are busy diagnosing pathology and prescribing the drug to treat that diagnosis. The problem with the conventional model is that the drug prescribed does not promote health as nearly all drugs poison enzymes and block receptors in the body.  There is a time and a place for drug therapies, but they are well over-prescribed in the US. The use of many drug therapies leaves the body depleted of vital nutrients that it will need when confronted with something like COVID.  As I previously stated, the Center for Holistic Medicine currently has 85 COVID patients who are all doing well and have not been hospitalized. There were some I was worried about—they kept me up at night. I called them daily to monitor their progress.  Having them increase the frequency of nebulizing hydrogen peroxide and iodine helped them all. Some of the sickest were advised to nebulize every hour or two for a short period. IV therapies and ozone treatments have helped many.  This therapy has worked for helping COVID patients. It is sad that hospitalized COVID patients are not given the proper nutritional support when they are admitted.  In a perfect world, I would immediately start an IV of vitamin C and begin nebulizing any hospitalized COVID patient with hydrogen peroxide and iodine. I am sure that would markedly lower the need for mechanical ventilation.  Final Thoughts:  Like most holistic therapies, the earlier they are started in a disease process the better they perform. AT THE FIRST SIGN OF A VIRAL ILLNESS I ENCOURAGE MY PATIENTS TO START MY VIRAL PROTOCOL OF TAKING VITAMINS A, C, D AND IODINE. Due to the severity of COVID, I now recommend starting to nebulize hydrogen peroxide and iodine early into the illness as well.  Better times are coming. Keep me updated on how you are doing. I will much more to talk about in relation to COVID. More posts will be coming soon.  To All Our Health,  ~DrB  Source.",0
"This briefing has ended. Read global live updates on the coronavirus here.  Countries around the world are weighing the costs and benefits of reopening society.The coronavirus pandemic continued its global assault on Saturday, with more than 1.7 million known cases recorded worldwide and at least 107,000 deaths. But even as some countries join the list of those with broad lockdown orders and others maintain or extend sweeping shutdowns, others have begun eyeing the benefits of reopening at least some parts of society. In Iran, the hardest-hit country so far in its region, some government offices and shops, factories and other businesses began reopening on Saturday as the national lockdown is lifted in phases. President Hassan Rouhani had said last week that economic and government activity must continue. On Saturday, he said that people should still observe social distancing. The lifting of restrictions came despite warnings from the country’s health ministry that the reopening could cause a new spike in cases and tens of thousands of additional deaths. Some of the most grievously hit countries in Europe, while still recording hundreds of new deaths every day, say that the worst appears to be past. Their plans to ease some restrictions, they caution, will not bring normalcy, but instead a new phase of learning how to safely live with the pandemic. [Analysis: Oil collapse and covid-19 create toxic geopolitical stew.]Spain, with the world’s highest caseload after the United States, is preparing to allow some nonessential employees to return to work on Monday. The country has reported a falling death rate and a daily growth in new cases of about 3 percent, compared with 20 percent in mid-March. But officials stressed the limits of that easing. “Spain continues in a state of lockdown,” Health Minister Salvador Illa warned  on Friday. “We are not yet in a de-escalation phase.” Italy, which follows Spain in cases but has the highest death toll after the United States, will allow some bookstores, children’s clothing shops and some forestry-related occupations to resume operations after the current restrictions expire on Tuesday. Austria plans to reopen smaller shops after this weekend. The Czech Republic is opening small stores, and people can play tennis and go swimming.  Denmark may reopen kindergartens and schools starting next week, Norway will allow pupils to attend kindergarten. And China has ended its lockdown of Wuhan, where the coronavirus first emerged.For many countries, the question of whether to ease restrictions does not have a clear answer yet. In the United States, President Trump — and governors of each state — are balancing calls from medical experts to keep restrictions in place with pleas from bankers, corporate executives and industrialists to ease them. India, on the other hand, appears set to extend a 21-day lockdown for all 1.3 billion citizens for two more weeks, carrying it to the end of April. During a meeting with top officials, Mr. Modi said the lockdown had helped blunt the outbreak but that “constant vigilance is paramount,” according to a statement from his office. Some countries put in place new measures. Turkey on Friday ordered a two-day curfew for 31 provinces. And Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has ordered air traffic to the country halted after more than 70 people who arrived from Newark, N.J., on Saturday morning left Ben Gurion Airport without official verifications of their mandatory quarantine plans and checks of their temperatures. A Times examination reveals the extent of President Trump’s slow response to the virus, which has now claimed more than 20,000 lives in the U.S. Throughout January, as President Trump repeatedly played down the seriousness of the virus and focused on other issues, an array of figures inside his government — from top White House advisers to experts deep in the cabinet departments and intelligence agencies — identified the threat, sounded alarms and made clear the need for aggressive action. Dozens of interviews and a review of emails and other records by The New York Times revealed many previously unreported details of the roots and extent of Mr. Trump’s halting response.  Read the full investigation. The country now has more than 515,000 confirmed cases, by far the world’s largest count, and more than 20,000 deaths, surpassing Italy’s as the world’s heaviest toll.  More than 16 million Americans have lost their jobs. Here’s what else is happening in the United States:On Saturday,  the U.S. surpassed Italy in the total number of confirmed deaths from the coronavirus with 20,109. Government projections obtained by The New York Times  found that without any mitigation, the death toll from the virus could have reached 300,000 — and that it could reach 200,000 if the Trump administration lifts 30-day stay-at-home orders.  Read the latest updates for the United States. Christians across the United States prepared to celebrate Easter by gathering virtually on Sunday, largely following stay-at-home orders and guidance from health officials. A handful of lone pastors in states like Louisiana and Mississippi plan to hold in-person services in defiance of restrictions on mass gatherings, citing their religious freedoms. President Trump said in a tweet that he will watch the online service of First Baptist Dallas, led by Robert Jeffress, one of his prominent supporters.The largest states are split on when and how to reopen. The governors of Texas and Florida, both Republicans, have started talking about reopening businesses and schools, echoing signals from Mr. Trump. But the leaders of California and New York, both Democrats, are sounding more cautious notes. Top officials in New York,  the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak with more than 180,000 cases, appear to disagree over whether New York City schools will remain closed for the rest of the academic year.  Read the latest updates for the New York region.Citing the virus, the Trump administration announced that it would issue visa penalties on countries that refuse to accept people the U.S. aims to deport. With so many restaurants and schools closed and other sources of demand disrupted, many of the largest farms in the country are  being forced to destroy tens of millions of pounds of fresh food that they haven’t been able to sell or donate to food banks, which can only absorb so much perishable food. As coronavirus cases rise in Latin America, murder rates fall. As countries contend with escalating body counts from the pandemic, some are experiencing an unanticipated decline in a different form of death: murder. Lockdowns have reduced opportunities for homicides and other crimes, and the virus has taken some criminals out of action as they hunker down in their homes. Some gangs have even led efforts to impose curfews in neighborhoods where they hold sway. The drop in murders is especially notable in Latin America, the region with the highest homicide rates in the world outside of war. In El Salvador, for example, there were just 65 homicides in March, down from 114 in February. Neighboring Honduras has also seen a falloff in killings in recent weeks, as has Colombia and the most populous state in Mexico. The pandemic is “taking people off the streets,” said Alejandro Hope, a security analyst in Mexico City. “The rule of thumb is: the stricter the lockdown, the bigger the effect on crimes committed against strangers on the street.” Here are other developments in the pandemic around the world:Italy’s coronavirus outbreak is one of the world’s deadliest, counting more than 152,000 cases and more than 19,450 deaths. Health care workers have been hard-hit, and so has another force on the front lines: The virus has killed nearly 100 priests.France, which has the world’s fifth largest known outbreak, reported on Saturday that the total number of patients in intensive care fell for the third day in a row, to roughly 6,880. With nearly 94,000 cases, the country has logged more than 13,800 deaths.Tokyo reported a record number of new cases on Saturday, at 197. The city has confirmed a total of 40 deaths from the virus. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Japan had not yet hit its target of reducing commuting by at least 70 percent, and asked all businesses to let employees work from home.Chile will start handing out certificates to people who have recovered that will exempt them from quarantines and other restrictions.The World Health Organization said that it was looking into reports of some recovering Covid-19 patients testing positive again after testing negative, a day after South Korean officials said that 91 previously cleared patients had tested positive again. Jeong Eun-kyeong, the director of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told a briefing that the virus might have been “reactivated” rather than the patients being reinfected. China delays exports of ventilators and other crucial medical supplies for quality checks. The Chinese government has ordered that no more N95 respirators, ventilators, hospital gowns and other key medical supplies be exported until customs officials perform quality inspections on each shipment. The new policy, announced by China’s General Administration of Customs on Friday, produced immediate delays to cargos on Saturday as manufacturers, freight agents and traders tried to understand how to comply. China is the world’s dominant producer of a wide range of medical supplies, and its manufacturing lead has widened in many sectors as it has engaged in a nationwide mobilization of medical supplies production since late January. The Chinese customs agency said that it had previously checked whether medical supplies were accurately counted, whether they infringed foreign patents and other intellectual property, and whether they had fraudulent documents. But now the agency will also assess the quality of goods. The agency gave no indication of how long the quality testing might take.The policy comes after a series of complaints from Europe that medical supplies from China had problems. Chinese officials have countered that many of these supplies were industrial respirators that were not designed to meet medical standards and should not be expected to do so. The new rules cover China’s exports in 11 categories: medical respirators and surgical masks, medical protective clothing, infrared thermometers, ventilators, surgical caps, medical goggles, medical gloves, medical shoe covers, patient monitors, medical disinfection towels and medical disinfectants. Montreal police open a criminal investigation into deaths at a nursing home. The police in Montreal said on Saturday night that they had launched a criminal investigation into a private residence for the elderly after 31 people had died there since March 13, at least five of them from confirmed cases of Covid-19. Quebec’s premier, François Legault, said that the government had learned of the deaths at the 150-bed Résidence Herron, in a suburb west of Montreal, on Friday, and that he believed they amounted to “gross negligence.” “This is terrible what happened,” Mr. Legault said on Saturday, adding that when officials from the regional health authority had arrived at the residence on March 29 to investigate, “almost all the staff was gone.” At that point, he said, the authority dispatched a team of health workers to care for the residents, and it has now taken over the running of the residence. An investigation by Montreal Gazette, a local newspaper, said that residents had been discovered unfed and wearing clothing covered with feces. Mr. Legault said that it was “unacceptable” how the elderly were being cared for in Quebec, and that staff shortages and insufficient salaries had been an ongoing issue at privately run residences. “I am not proud to see what is happening,” he said. Résidence Herron is owned by a Quebec real estate company called Katasa, which owns six other retirement residences. The company was not immediately available for comment on Saturday. But it previously said it had been doing its best under challenging circumstances. Quebec has been hit hard by the coronavirus. As of Saturday, it had 12,292 confirmed cases and 289 deaths. More than 90 percent of those who have died were 70 or older. Officials said Saturday that after one resident at the Herron had tested positive for the virus, regional health authorities had reached out to the residence to learn more about the status of its residents, but were rebuffed. The authorities then obtained a court order to gain access to medical files, and learned of the number of deaths on Friday. Quebec’s minister of health, Danielle McCann, ordered checks of private residences for the elderly across the province. More than 50 workers chose isolation at their power plant to keep Vienna’s lights on. The global pandemic has forced countless people into isolation. In Vienna, for the sake of the entire city, 53 people volunteered. They raised their hands to ensure that whatever else happens, the power plants that provide electricity to Austria’s capital and its 2 million people would keep running. The 53 employees of the Wien Energie company have been holed up in four power plants since March 20, after volunteering to go into their own version of a lockdown until April 16. Depending on how things go, they could be asked to stay on longer. The workers miss their families, but shrug off the idea that they are making a big sacrifice, pointing out that doctors, nurses and other health workers had it much tougher. “We are just a cog in a much bigger wheel,” said Steven Sacher, 24, an engineer at the Flötzersteig plant. Wien Energie turned conference rooms into dormitories, and outfitted the plants with washing machines, fitness equipment, wireless internet — and, crucially, board games and jigsaw puzzles. “We have finished about 20 puzzles with 2,000 pieces,” Mr. Wallner said. “Everyone who has time stops and works on it a bit.” Mr. Sacher said his team has been piecing together a puzzle showing the Brooklyn Bridge at night, which gives way to an evening ritual. “Every night at 9 p.m. sharp, the four of us who aren’t working get together and play Parcheesi,” he said. Pope Francis will say Easter Mass and deliver an annual message by live-stream. Last year, the Vatican’s police force estimated that 70,000 faithful crammed into St. Peter’s Square on Easter morning to hear the pope deliver his “Urbi et Orbi” (“To the City and to the World”) message after the Easter Mass. But on Sunday, Pope Francis won’t impart his Easter message and blessing from a window in the apostolic palace, from where he greets the faithful most Sundays. Instead, Francis will live-stream the Mass, followed by the message and a blessing, on the Vatican news website, starting at 11 a.m. local time (5 a.m. Eastern). People are prohibited from gathering in the square. And the Francis will celebrate Mass with just a few assistants inside the empty basilica. The Vatican also live-streamed the Via Crucis, the traditional Good Friday procession that evokes the Stations of the Cross leading up to Christ’s crucifixion, in St. Peter’s Square instead of Rome’s Colosseum, where it is traditionally held. At the end of the procession, Francis prayed silently before a wooden crucifix that had been carried during Rome’s 16th-century plague. Earlier Friday, Francis called an Italian state TV Good Friday special to say he felt close to the victims of the pandemic, and that he was thinking about the “doctors, nurses, nuns and priests who had died on the front lines as soldiers, giving their life for love.” In this pandemic, many are resisting, in their communities, in hospitals, caring for the ill. “Even today people are crucified, and die for love,” Francis said. At over 100 years old, they’ve defied the odds and beat the virus. As the coronavirus pandemic takes a disproportionate toll on older people around the world, several over the age of 100 have survived the brutal toll the disease takes on the body. Cornelia Ras, 107, of the Netherlands is believed to be the oldest known survivor of the new coronavirus. She became ill last month after attending a church service on the island of Goeree-Overflakkee in the southwest part of the country. Ms. Ras was given the all clear by her doctor on Monday.“We did not expect her to survive this,” her niece Maaike de Groot told the Dutch newspaper AD. “She takes no medicines, still walks well and gets down on her knees every night to thank the Lord. From the looks of it, she will be able to continue to do so.” Keith Watson, a 101-year-old man from western England, was in a hospital last month awaiting surgery when he developed a fever that prompted doctors to test him for the coronavirus, local health officials said. But he pulled through, and on Thursday, he was discharged after recovering from the virus. “He’s amazing for his age,” his daughter-in-law Jo Watson told the BBC. On March 9, Ada Zanusso, 103, was one of several residents of a nursing home in the town of Lessona, Italy, to become ill with the coronavirus. Twenty people had already died there, the newspaper La Repubblica reported. “She was ill for a week, even with critical moments,” said Carla Furno Marchese, Mrs. Zanusso’s family doctor since 1986, who also works with the nursing home. Then, “miraculously,” Dr. Furno Marchese said in an interview, Ms. Zanusso improved. “She reacquired some strength, started eating again and then she got out of bed,” the doctor said. “Now she’s perfectly normal, like before. She’s doing great. She remembers everything.” Her recovery has been embraced by many Italians still reeling from the toll the virus has taken on the country, which is enduring a lockdown. Ms. Zanusso had lived alone at home until four years ago, when she broke her femur and her children decided she would be better off in a care home. She had always been in good health, and has a deep faith.  “She accepts everything that happens to her,” the doctor said. Tech giants team up to track the virus, as South Korea tightens its leading program. In one of the most far-ranging attempts to halt the spread of the coronavirus, Apple and Google said they were building software into smartphones that would tell people if they were recently in contact with someone who was infected with it. The technology giants, usually fierce rivals, said they aimed to release the tool within several months, building it into the operating systems of billions of iPhones and Android devices around the world. Users would opt in and voluntarily report if they became infected, and the smartphones would log other devices they came near, enabling “contact tracing” of the disease, a measure that has proved effective, alongside mass testing in places like South Korea. “It could be a useful tool, but it raises privacy issues,” said Dr. Mike Reid, an assistant professor of medicine and infectious diseases at the University of California, San Francisco, who is helping San Francisco officials with contact tracing. “It’s not going to be the sole solution, but as part of a robust sophisticated response, it has a role to play.” South Korea, which has used a government-issued tracking app to trace contacts and enforce quarantine, said on Saturday that it planned to strap tracking wristbands on those who violated self-quarantine orders. Health officials worry that some of the 57,000 people who are under orders to stay home for two weeks have slipped out, leaving their smartphones behind. Yoon Tae-ho, a senior disease-control official, told reporters on Saturday that the bands would be deployed within two weeks. Officials admitted that they lacked a legal power to enforce wristband-wearing, but could consider lighter quarantine-breaking penalties to those who agreed to wear them. South Korea has reported between 27 and 53 new cases per day this week compared with several hundred a day between late February and early March. A British minister draws backlash for urging no ‘overuse’ of protective gear. The British health secretary, Matt Hancock, has sparked anger among workers in the country’s National Health Service after he urged them not to waste personal protective equipment. The British Medical Association, which represents doctors, warned on Saturday that supplies of personal protective equipment, or P.P.E., were dangerously low in London and part of northern England, and said that doctors were putting their lives at risk to treat patients with the coronavirus. “It’s really important that people don’t overuse P.P.E.,” Mr. Hancock said in a BBC radio interview on Saturday. “It’s a precious resource.” At a daily briefing on Friday, he said that masks and aprons did not have to be changed after treating each patient. But the Royal College of Nursing’s general secretary, Donna Kinnair, told BBC’s “Breakfast” show: “I take offense, actually, that we are saying that health care workers are abusing or overusing P.P.E. I think what we know is, we don’t have enough supply.” The opposition Labour Party leader, Keir Starmer, also said on Twitter: “It is quite frankly insulting to imply frontline staff are wasting PPE. There are horrific stories of NHS staff and care workers not having the equipment they need to keep them safe.” Mr. Hancock also said on Saturday that 19 health service workers had died so far in the outbreak. Britain reported a daily total of 917 deaths in hospitals on Saturday, after a high of 980 on Friday. The total death toll stood at 9,975 as of Saturday. He said the outbreak had yet to peak, although there were signs of hospital admissions “starting to flatten.” With temperatures expected to reach up to 75 degrees Fahrenheit this weekend, government officials have warned the British public to continue to abide by lockdown restrictions. The condition of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, meanwhile, has continued to improve, his office said in a statement on Friday, adding that he had “been able to do short walks, between periods of rest.” He left intensive care on Thursday after three nights but remains in a hospital. After giving a rare televised address to the nation on Sunday, Queen Elizabeth II again delivered a message to Britons. She encouraged people to continue practicing social distancing and said that “Easter isn’t canceled.” “We know that coronavirus will not overcome us,” she said. “As dark as death can be, particularly for those suffering with grief, light and life are greater.” The pandemic is bringing old internet dreams to life. It’s been decades since utopian thinkers dreamed that cyberspace would miraculously fix societal woes. Yet the pandemic has prompted some to realize that social media — where we normally just promote ourselves — can be mobilized for building a sense of community. In the United States, artists are singing opera, reading poetry and doing standup comedy on You-Tube and Instagram. These days, our reporter writes in The New York Times Magazine, online performances feel “as though they were really less about pure entertainment and more about serving a nation, a world even, that was suffering in isolation and fear.” Healing practitioners have also made meditation sessions, yoga classes and other mental-health assistance available free online. And GoFundMe is a vehicle for distributing money to people hit hardest by the crisis, including sex workers and underinsured artists.

"April 20 has long been a celebration of all things weed, but this year was supposed to be different in Illinois.  Coming just over three months after pot was legalized for recreational use, 4/20 offered an opportunity for the state’s residents to publicly embrace cannabis and its colorful subculture, which has swiftly shifted from the underground to Main Street.  But as the number of COVID-19 cases continued to rise late last month, Gov. J.B. Pritzker effectively put the kibosh on any 4/20 parties when he extended a statewide stay-at-home order until May that prohibits large gatherings.  Dispensary 33 has since announced that the third annual Waldo’s Forever Fest, a huge, bud-friendly bash slated to take place Saturday outside the pot shop at Clark and Division, will now be held online using the Twitch app. The physical event has tentatively been rescheduled for Sept. 26.  “This 4/20 was going to be on a whole ‘nother level. We were super excited to blow it out with the street festival. I think we were going to have twice the size of out footprint last year,” Dispensary 33 spokeswoman Abigail Watkins said of the event, which drew thousands last year.  Consumption allowed — at home  Watkins said the socially distanced shindig, scheduled to start at 4:20 p.m. on Saturday, looks to “showcase different personalities and different people’s talents in the cannabis community all throughout Chicago.” The bill features a live-stream of local DJs and glass blowers, as well as stony Chicago sibling rockers White Mystery and drag performers Lucy Stoole and Shea Coulee, a finalist on “RuPaul’s Drag Race.”  “I still think it’ll be fun and we’ll still be able to connect people through cannabis and celebrate,” said Watkins. “Also people are going to be able to smoke at home and actually celebrate 4/20 with consumption, which there wasn’t going to be consumption on-site at the fest” — since public consumption remains illegal.  With much of the country ordered to stay home, similar virtual events offer pot users a way to observe the “high” holiday from their living rooms. One celebration scheduled for Monday and dubbed Higher Together features a DJ set and smoke session with rapper and reefer enthusiast Wiz Khalifa and a performance by Billy Ray Cyrus.  All proceeds from a donation drive will go to the Last Prisoner Project, a nonprofit that seeks to address the harms of cannabis prohibition and is circulating a petition to urge President Donald Trump and the Federal Bureau of Prisons “to take the necessary steps to mitigate the effects of the coronavirus on our incarcerated communities.”  2nd pot event moves online  Meanwhile, Monday’s second annual Chicago Cannabis Health and Wellness Fair at Olive-Harvey College is also moving online.  Organized by the Chicago Cannabis Health Initiative, the event boasts pot-centric panels, demonstrations and presentations on a range of topics, including weed-infused cooking, cannabis rights and using the drug to deal with pain and post-traumatic stress disorder. Donte Townsend, founder of the Chicago chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, an advocacy group co-sponsoring the event, will give a virtual talk on CBD & hemp, a plant he’s been cultivating at a huge growth facility in Putnam County.  Though Townsend said it’s “a little heartbreaking” that plans had to be changed in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, he tried to look on the bright side.  “With what’s going on, we’ve found ways to be able to still offer a free service to the public about health and the beneficial uses of cannabis in its multiple forms that people can access from home,” he said.",1
"More than half of the 69 immigrant children sheltered by the nonprofit Heartland Alliance in Chicago have tested positive for the coronavirus, the organization announced Tuesday.  “While we are not going to share the details of any specific child in our care, there have been 37 confirmed positive diagnoses to date,” Heartland Alliance spokeswoman Mailee Garcia said.  “We are operating under the assumption that we will see additional positive diagnoses as we receive results from the other tests that have been administered, and the steps we are taking to ensure the health and safety of our participants and staff are based on that assumption.”  Garcia said the prognosis for the children “is very good,” adding that the nonprofit “aggressively moved to obtain testing for all of the children in our care — even those who are asymptomatic.”  Heartland Alliance operates three dormitory-like shelters for unaccompanied immigrant youth in the city, ranging from infants to 17 years old.  Garcia said only one shelter has reported positive cases of the coronavirus. Children who tested positive have been isolated, while employees are also being screened for COVID-19 symptoms prior to each shift. A professional cleaning company has been hired to sanitize the facilities, Garcia said.  ProPublica Illinois first reported the positive cases of the virus at the shelter Monday. ProPublica reported that two staff members have also tested positive.  According to an internal staff email reviewed by ProPublica, the first positive cases of the virus came to light Friday at Heartland’s shelter in Bronzeville. The total number of cases had risen to 19 by the end of the weekend.  As of Monday, the Office of Refugee Resettlement — the federal agency that places unaccompanied migrant children in shelters across the country — said it had identified 21 cases of COVID-19 across all of its partner facilities.  Those cases were reported “in two Texas programs, and one Illinois program,” according to the agency, making the outbreak at Heartland’s shelter the largest of its kind in the country.  The Sun-Times reported in June 2018 that Heartland Alliance was sheltering children who had been separated from their parents at the southern border. The Trump administration said last April it could take up to two years to reunite all of those families.  In a statement released Monday, the National Immigrant Justice Center, a branch of Heartland Alliance, said the Trump administration has “obstructed” the release of unaccompanied migrant children to their family members and sponsors.  “[The Office of Refugee Resettlement] must immediately release as many children as possible, and allow them to reunite with caretakers in homes where they can safely follow local governments’ shelter-in-place guidelines,” the justice center said.  Citing new health guidelines issued during the coronavirus pandemic, the Trump administration has deported more than 400 unaccompanied migrant children intercepted at the border since March 21, according to Reuters.

"Putin considers using Armed Forces to combat Covid-19  Yesterday, President Vladimir Putin admitted that it could be possible to use ""opportunities"" and ""reserves"" of the Ministry of Defense in the fight against the spread of coronavirus in Russia. Representatives of the ministry said, however, that they estimate the situation with the coronavirus infection in the armed forces as ""unstable.""  As of March 30, three Russian military personnel were confirmed positive for COVID-19 infection, at least 133 more people remain under medical observation due to their contacts with the infected.    The Defense Ministry of the Russian Federation decided not to cancel the spring draft and intends to recruit 135,000 conscripts, although they are not going to be sent to military troops in the near future.  The epidemiological situation in the Russian armed forces is unstable, an unnamed source said. The ministry has prepared nearly 5,000 beds at 32 military hospitals, 11 of which ""are ready for work within four hours under strict anti-epidemic conditions."" Forty-nine mobile sanitary-epidemiological groups were also set up for an operational response. The Ministry has 2 million medical disposable masks, 15,000 respirators, 100 insulating transport capsules, 10,000 disposable suits for infectious disease specialists, 3,000 medical protective suits of the Quartz type and continues purchasing necessary items.  It is worth noting that even in an emergency-case scenario, Russia will not be able to directly take advantage of the experience gained abroad. All military personnel arriving from foreign trips undergo a ""mandatory two-week observation"". This also applies to military doctors who are now serving in Italy and Serbia.",0
"Entering March, the Blackhawks already looked like a team primed to use a buyout in the offseason.  The odds of that happening — whenever the offseason ends up taking place — have only increased in the last two months.  The NHL already has lost a significant chunk of revenue because of the season pause, and if the season is canceled or only somewhat resumed, that chunk will get larger.  And since the salary cap is directly correlated to league revenues — it’s technically half the upcoming season’s projected revenue, divided by 31 — that huge financial fallout could quickly spill down to the player’s pockets.  The Hawks already were looking at a salary-cap crunch, even with the cap expected to rise from its current $81.5 million to the $84 million-$88 million range. But if the cap stays around $81.5 million — which players were reportedly informed recently will likely be the case — general manager Stan Bowman’s situation could get even more dire.  That could affect the Hawks’ ability to re-sign pending free agents such as Dylan Strome, Dominik Kubalik and Corey Crawford.  But it also could — alternately, or perhaps simultaneously — lead to one or two buyouts of Hawks players with years left on their contracts.  Under the standard buyout rules — which are complicated and highly variable but generally spread out a player’s expected cap hit over more years at a lower amount per year — the Hawks have two prime candidates: defenseman Olli Maatta and forward Zack Smith.  Maatta was acquired from the Penguins last summer to help fix the Hawks’ defense. He didn’t have an outright bad debut season, but he made little difference. Maatta finished with 17 points and a 47.5 percent scoring-chance ratio (per Natural Stat Trick) in 65 games.  He has two years remaining at an expensive $4.08 million cap hit per year, and it just so happens that his contract is buyout-friendly. It would result in a mere $680,000 cap hit for the next four years, per Capfriendly.  Olli Maatta Buyout Data Season Current Cap Hit Buyout Cap Hit Savings Season Current Cap Hit Buyout Cap Hit Savings 2020-21 4,083,333 680,600 3,402,733 2021-22 4,083,333 680,400 3,402,933 2022-23 0 680,567 -680,567 2023-24 0 680,567 -680,567  The Hawks acquired Smith from the Senators last summer while dumping Artem Anisimov’s contract.  But Smith, too, is heavily overpaid (one year remaining at $3.25 million) for a slowing-down fourth-liner. He finished with 11 points and a team-worst 40.4 percent scoring-chance ratio in 50 games, then was ruled out for the season with a back injury.  His contract is slightly less buyout-friendly than Maatta’s, but he’s also a far more expendable player. A buyout would create a cap hit slightly under $1.1 million for the next two seasons.  Zack Smith Buyout Data Season Current Cap Hit Buyout Cap Hit Savings Season Current Cap Hit Buyout Cap Hit Savings 2020-21 3,250,000 1,083,333 2,166,667 2021-22 0 1,083,333 -1,083,333  Meanwhile, the NHL could look into offering compliance buyouts, which completely erase contracts from the books with no penalties. The league offered these in the 2013 and 2014 offseasons after the 2012-13 lockout stalled cap growth.  In this scenario, the choice would be clear for the Hawks: Brent Seabrook’s contract is an albatross. He’s due $6.875 million for four more seasons. Despite Seabrook’s admirable fight back from three surgeries during the winter, Bowman would be delusional not to use a compliance buyout on the one-time defensive stalwart.  Brent Seabrook Compliance Buyout Data Season Current Cap Hit Buyout Cap Hit Savings Season Current Cap Hit Buyout Cap Hit Savings 2020-21 6,875,000 0 6,875,000 2021-22 6,875,000 0 6,875,000 2022-23 6,875,000 0 6,875,000 2023-24 6,875,000 0 6,875,000  But a conventional buyout remains impractical. Most of Seabrook’s cap hit is packed into a signing bonus that can’t be mitigated in any way.",1
"Researchers have confirmed that there are several effective methods for decontaminating the N95 masks worn by health professionals so that they can be used more than once, the National Institutes of Health announced Wednesday. A substantial body of research already showed that the masks, designed for one-time use, can be reused in a crisis. And the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in March authorized reuse because of shortages driven by the Covid-19 pandemic. In recent weeks the Food and Drug Administration has issued emergency approvals for several systems of mask decontamination. None of these rules or methods are intended for the cloth masks recommended or in some locations required for use by everyone in public. The C.D.C. advises regular washing of homemade fabric masks in a washing machine. Earlier research had not, of course, involved the new coronavirus. The new research, done at the Rocky Mountain Laboratories of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and used live novel coronavirus, formally known as SARS-CoV-2, to test the mask material. The study determined which decontamination procedures were most effective, and how they affected the integrity of the masks. Vincent Munster, one of the authors of the new work, who collaborated with other government researchers and scientists at the University of California, Los Angeles, said the work built on more than a decade of studies of decontamination. “We showed that it actually works as well for SARS-CoV-2 as for influenza,” and for bacteria, he said. The research was posted on MedRxiv, a website where scientists have been posting articles submitted for publication elsewhere that have not yet been through peer review. But N.I.H. publicized the study because it could be helpful to health care professionals in the midst of a crisis, and it was validating and extending previous work, not suggesting untried methods. Dr. Munster and his colleagues tested four methods of killing the virus: UV light, dry heat, vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) and ethyl alcohol. Of those methods, they did not recommend ethyl alcohol because although it killed the virus, it degraded the mask material. The researchers first tested samples of N95 material to which live virus had been applied. That work was done in a biosecure lab. After treatment, they cultured virus particles from the material to see if the shielding remained effective in limiting transmission. Then they tested the same methods on whole masks without the virus to determine whether their structure and functioning were damaged after rounds of decontamination. Dr. Munster said that even if decontamination worked perfectly, but the mask no longer fit “then obviously your mask is not really good for reuse anymore.” Vaporized hydrogen peroxide, a method often available in large hospitals, was effective, and left the masks still functioning for at least three rounds of decontamination, as did UV light. Dry heat, at 70 degrees Celsius or 158 degrees Fahrenheit, was effective, but the masks withstood only two rounds of decontamination. Dr. Munster said that “vaporized hydrogen peroxide would be the method of choice if that’s available.” However, he said, a nursing home might not have that, while for dry heat, what’s needed is basically an oven. Dr. Lynn Goldman, dean of George Washington University’s Milken Institute School of Public Health, said in an email that she thought the new research was an “excellent contribution.” She said it was “helpful to see that either VHP or UV can effectively sterilize N95 masks and make them available for reuse up to three times.” Another recent study from Canadian researchers, also not yet peer reviewed, confirmed the value of decontamination. It included masks of different brands and found that the material of the mask was still effective after 10 rounds of vaporized hydrogen peroxide decontamination. One of the authors of that paper, Dr. Anand Kumar at the University of Manitoba, said that his procedure was slightly different from Dr. Munster’s in that it did not test the structure and facial fit of the mask, only the filtering ability of the material. The recommendations and findings in the two papers are intended to be useful for institutions that have health care workers wearing N95 masks. With personal protective equipment in short supply at many overwhelmed hospitals, some front-line workers, including doctors and nurses, have complained that masks were rationed. The public has been advised not to use or try to buy N95 masks because they would be depriving health care workers of lifesaving equipment. “And if they do, they shouldn’t try decontaminating them,” Dr. Kumar said.",1
"In Vietnam, There Have Been Fewer Than 300 COVID-19 Cases And No Deaths. Here's Why  Enlarge this image toggle caption Nhac Nguyen/AFP via Getty Images Nhac Nguyen/AFP via Getty Images  Vietnam shares a border with China, yet it has reported no deaths from COVID-19 and just 268 confirmed cases, when other Southeast Asian nations are reporting thousands.  Experts say experience dealing with prior pandemics, early implementation of aggressive social distancing policies, strong action from political leaders and the muscle of a one-party authoritarian state have helped Vietnam.  ""They had political commitment early on at the highest level,"" says John MacArthur, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's country representative in neighboring Thailand. ""And that political commitment went from central level all the way down to the hamlet level.""  With experience gained from dealing with the 2003 SARS and 2009 H1N1 pandemics, Vietnam's government started organizing its response in January — as soon as reports began trickling in from Wuhan, China, where the virus is believed to have originated. The country quickly came up with a variety of tactics, including widespread quarantining and aggressive contact tracing. It has also won praise from the World Health Organization and the CDC for its transparency in dealing with the crisis.  Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc recently characterized Vietnam's efforts as the ""spring general offensive of 2020,"" a reference to the 1968 Tet Offensive, which many claim helped turn the tide of the Vietnam War.  Tens of thousands have been put in quarantine camps. By the end of March, Vietnam had banned all international and domestic flights. The government locked down the country on April 1. State-run media say the current social distancing and stay-at-home orders are to be extended for at least another week.  Streets normally buzzing with motorcycles and cars are almost empty in most large cities. As the economic toll of the lockdown becomes apparent, some entrepreneurs are stepping up to help. One has provided ""rice ATMs"" to dispense free rice to those who are out of work.  Some may still be skeptical of Vietnam's relatively low COVID-19 case numbers. The CDC's MacArthur is not.  ""Our team up in Hanoi is working very, very closely with their Ministry of Health counterparts,"" he says. ""The communications I've had with my Vietnam team is that at this point in time, [they] don't have any indication that those numbers are false.",1
"This briefing is no longer updating. Read the latest developments in the coronavirus outbreak here. California and Texas received the most small-business relief funds. Money from the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program, which ran out of funds on Thursday, flowed heavily to California and Texas, with construction companies and manufacturers getting the largest number of loans, rather than harder-hit retailers and restaurants, according to new data. The nearly $350 billion in the Paycheck Protection Program also disproportionately flowed to states that have suffered fewer infections and deaths under the virus, like Kansas, than to harder-hit states like New York and New Jersey, when adjusting for the size of the small-business economy in each state. The new data, which include loan approvals through Thursday, show accommodation and food service firms have received less than 9 percent of the money from the program, about $30.5 billion, though they have suffered the largest job losses of any industry during this recession. Construction firms received the largest share, at just over 13 percent, or about $45 billion. Adjusting for the total amount of money that small businesses pay their employees and would be eligible to receive in loans to cover payroll, the Great Plains states emerge as big winners, with Nebraska, Kansas and the Dakotas receiving disproportionate shares of the money. By that metric, Nebraska did twice as well as New York. The S.B.A. program was intended for banks to distribute the loans, which the federal government will pay off in most cases. That structure benefited companies with existing relationships with banks. S.B.A. officials included data on the largest lending institutions in the program, though they were not identified. The top lender distributed more than $14 million in loans with an average size of more than $500,000 per loan — suggesting that the institution was giving loans to relatively large businesses. Stocks jump as investors rally behind the idea of reopening the economy. Stocks in the United States rallied on Friday, with efforts to reopen the economy taking center stage and investors undeterred by more data showing the economic damage of the coronavirus pandemic. The gains came after President Trump told governors on Thursday that they could begin reopening businesses in their states by May 1 or earlier, and Boeing — one of the nation’s largest manufacturers — said it planned to bring about 27,000 employees back to work in Washington State to resume aircraft production. The announcement is the first attempt at large-scale resumption of business activity by a U.S. corporation since the coronavirus outbreak forced companies and government officials to shut down most nonessential work. Boeing’s shares rose more than 14 percent on Friday. Some European automakers — including Volkswagen, Volvo and Daimler — are planning to restart assembly lines next week, staffed by workers in masks and protective clothing, sometimes separated from one another by plastic screens. Opel, a unit of the French automaker PSA, said it would reopen its German dealerships on Monday after the German government announced that it would gradually ease lockdown restrictions. The S&P 500 rose 2.7 percent, while Boeing’s gains led the Dow Jones industrial average to a 3 percent jump. After global stock markets nose-dived earlier this year, they have been rebounding since late March, as investors have routinely looked past evidence of the damage caused by stay-at-home orders and business shutdowns, and instead focused on hopes for an eventual recovery. The gains on Friday mean stocks ended the week higher, despite reports showing a historic plunge in retail sales and a continued surge in unemployment claims. The S&P 500 is now up more than 28 percent from its lowest point this year, which was reached on March 23. It is still nearly 18 percent below its high in late February. On Friday, the rally came after China reported that its economy — the world’s second-largest after that of the United States — shrank for the first time in decades. And data on car sales in Europe showed they collapsed. Some also saw hopeful signs in a report by the medical news website STAT that a drug from Gilead Sciences showed early — and, thus far, unproven — promise in fighting the coronavirus. According to STAT, the antiviral drug, remdesivir, has helped patients with severe symptoms recover rapidly in a clinical trial at a Chicago hospital. Gilead’s shares jumped nearly 10 percent. The Trump administration plans to funnel $19 billion to farmers.President Trump said Friday he would channel $19 billion to American farmers and ranchers that have been hurt by the fallout from coronavirus, payments that come on top of tens of billions of dollars of assistance given to farmers in the last year to offset the pain of the trade war with China. The Trump administration will make $16 billion in direct payments to farmers who have experienced losses from coronavirus, Mr. Trump said in a briefing Friday evening. It would also purchase a further $3 billion of fresh produce, dairy and meat that will be distributed through food banks and other community and faith organizations to people in need, he added. “These are great people, great Americans,” Mr. Trump said. “It is money well deserved. Not only were they targeted at one point by China, that was over a period of time, and they never complained.” Over the past year, the Trump administration has extended $28 billion to American farmers and ranchers to help offset the pain of a trade war with China. Mr. Trump ratcheted up tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese products in an effort to reach a trade deal, prompting China to respond with tariffs on American soybeans, pork, dairy and other products that crippled sales to one of the world’s largest markets. More news media outlets lay off workers. The news media industry continues to be shellacked by the dismal advertising market as businesses remain shuttered throughout much of the country. The New York Times now estimates that approximately 33,000 workers in the media industry have been affected by planned layoffs, pay cuts and furloughs, up from 28,000 last week. The magazine company Condé Nast announced on Monday that it was cutting the pay of nearly half its work force by 10 to 20 percent. The newspaper chain Advance Local — which shares a corporate parent with Condé — said this week that it would furlough employees for one to two weeks. Digital sites, whose subscription businesses are often immature or nonexistent, continue to impose cost-savings as a way to stanch the bleeding in the ad market. Slate, which converted its membership program, Slate Plus, into a paywall last month, is cutting all employees’ pay on a sliding scale. Vox Media, which purchased New York Media last year, is furloughing roughly 10 percent of its work force and cutting the pay of high-earning employees. The Los Angeles Times, one of the country’s largest newspapers by circulation, announced internally this week that it was furloughing 40 non-newsroom workers and cutting senior managers’ pay. It also shuttered three community weeklies, laying off 14 people, including guild members. The ride-sharing business has collapsed. In February, Uber said it had expected to bring in $16 billion to $17 billion in revenue this year. On Thursday, the company said it could no longer forecast what will happen. Lyft has not yet made a similar announcement, but there’s no reason to think it faces a different fate. Drawing from aggregated debit and credit card purchases of millions of U.S. consumers, for example, the analytics firm Second Measure found that spending on Uber’s rides dropped about 83 percent in March. And earnings tracker service Gridwise, using data collected from more than 30,000 drivers nationwide, found that the average hourly earnings of drivers dropped 36 percent from the beginning of March to the middle of the month. By the end of March, wages began to recover slightly, but were still down 24 percent. So how are the companies dealing with the slump? For now, the strategy appears to be: Wait it out, and deliver food — as much of it as possible. Uber’s money-losing food delivery service, Uber Eats, most likely surpassed Uber’s ride-hailing business in sales by mid-March and jumped about 27 percent for the month, according to Second Measure. Although Lyft had no food delivery business before the pandemic, it created a temporary one to deliver meals and groceries for students and seniors. And on Wednesday, Lyft expanded the program to 11 major cities, including Atlanta, Houston, San Francisco and Seattle. What to know about the proliferation of frauds around the coronavirus. Frauds around the coronavirus include businesses selling intravenous vitamin C drips to “boost immunity” to the virus, websites offering masks that never arrive and even reports of fake drive-up testing sites, where impostors swabbed people’s cheeks in exchange for cash. Here are some questions and answers about coronavirus-related fraud:How can I protect myself from coronavirus fraud?First, understand that there are currently no F.D.A.-approved vaccines or treatments for the coronavirus, said Noah Joshua Phillips, an F.T.C. commissioner. That will, hopefully, change — but you are unlikely to hear about it first via a shady robocall. The best thing to do if you get a suspicious call is to hang up, he said. What if I am expecting a government stimulus payment?Most people don’t have to do anything to get their economic stimulus payments, which the government is issuing to help people facing money troubles because of the virus. Those payments will be deposited into your bank account automatically, the I.R.S. said. “The I.R.S. isn’t going to call you asking to verify or provide your financial information” so you can get your payment faster, the head of the agency, Chuck Rettig, said in a statement this month. I saw a social media report about virus-related fraud occurring door to door. Is this true?Agencies including the F.B.I. have issued public warnings about people selling fake virus test kits and “unapproved treatments” on “door-to-door visits.” The inspector general for the Department of Health and Human Services also warned of “scammers” going door to door offering Covid-19 tests in exchange for personal details, like Medicare information. European car sales plummeted in March. New data on Friday gave the first concrete indication of how severely European carmakers were hit by coronavirus lockdowns, and it was every bit as bad as feared. New car registrations in the European Union fell 55 percent last month compared with a year earlier, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association said, as dealers closed their doors and buyers were stuck in their homes. Owners registered 570,000 new cars during the month, down from 1.3 million in March 2019. Sales all but evaporated in Italy, the European country that went into lockdown the earliest, falling 85 percent. Spain and France also suffered declines of around 70 percent. Carmakers that depend on southern Europe for sales also suffered the most. Fiat Chrysler sales plummeted 77 percent. PSA, whose brands include Peugeot, Citroën and Opel, suffered a 68 percent plunge in sales. German carmakers BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen fared marginally better, with declines of less than 50 percent. Catch up: Here’s what else is happening.Boeing will resume operations on Monday in the Philadelphia area, where it produces military aircraft such as the H-47 Chinook and V-22 Osprey. The work had been suspended for two weeks on April 3. On Thursday, Boeing said it planned to bring back 27,000 workers next week to facilities in Washington State to work on commercial aircraft production.Walmart said that it had hired 150,000 workers since March 19, and it pledged to hire 50,000 more. The retailer said it had received more than a million applications since its initial hiring announcement. The new workers will be hired on a temporary basis, it said, adding that many had been furloughed from other companies and were looking to bridge the gap until they returned to their original jobs.The organizers behind San Diego Comic Con, the annual pop culture celebration, announced on Friday that the event was canceled, the first time in its 50-year history. Fans who purchased badges can request a refund or transfer their badges to next year’s event.Ford Motor said it expected to report a $2 billion loss for the first quarter, on revenue of $34 billion. The announcement came in a regulatory filing ahead of a full quarterly report on April 28. The automaker said earlier this week that its first-quarter wholesale volume was down 21 percent from a year earlier, mainly because of the outbreak’s impact on production and demand.

"Most Fire players are in their 20s and have many years left in their careers. Many of them haven’t even hit the high point of their time in the game and are still on the ascent.  At 35, left back Jonathan Bornstein still has plenty left to give on the field, but his timeline is different than his colleagues’ and the end is closer than the beginning. And as COVID-19 eats away at the season, it’s taking away from the moments he has left in competitive soccer.  “I’ve thought about that, actually, quite a bit,” Bornstein said. “Obviously, the closer you get to the end of your career, you almost cherish every game, every practice a little bit more. Not being able to train with the team due to extenuating circumstances is a bit of a Debbie Downer kind of a thing, but at the same time I’m very thankful that my family and I are healthy and we’re here with the support of the team.”  That isn’t to say the end of Bornstein’s career is imminent. He certainly doesn’t think so, and the way his time in Chicago has started indicates he can still play at a high level.  After joining the Fire last summer, Bornstein solidified a spot that had given the team trouble and helped the back line finally mesh. Bornstein’s strong form carried over to the first two games of 2020, and he even scored in the Fire’s 1-1 draw March 7 at New England to help secure the team’s first point of the year.  As it turned out, that would be their last appearance for a long time. The pandemic halted the sports world the next week, and it’s unclear when and how the season will resume and when Bornstein will be reunited with his teammates.  Bornstein already is looking forward to that moment, whenever it arrives. But it won’t be the start of a farewell.  “Once we get started again, I’ll be even that much more anxious to be on the field and to be making the most of my time that I have left,” Bornstein said. “I try not to think too much about it because, to be honest, my goal is to play until I’m 40, so I’ve got another five years, if it all goes to plan. I try not to let the situation get me down as much as I can.”  The thing is, nobody knows when soccer will return. Bornstein is hoping it comes back sooner than later. He’d rather play in the summer than the end of 2020. But he doesn’t have control over the timeline.  He’s just trying to stay mentally and physically prepared for whatever comes his way.  “I think the uncertainty in any aspect of life is always what’s scary,” Bornstein said. “Doubt casts a shadow upon what could be, what couldn’t be, and at this point, we’re almost all living in the shadow of doubt. It’s a bit of an unsettling thought, but you’ve got to have faith that eventually we’re going to get through all of this and we’ll be able to get back to some sort of normality.”",1

"IOWA CITY, Iowa — Tyson Foods suspended operations Wednesday at an Iowa plant that is critical to the nation’s pork supply but was blamed for fueling a massive coronavirus outbreak in the region.  The Arkansas-based company said the closure of the plant in Waterloo would deny a vital market to hog farmers and further disrupt U.S. meat supply. Tyson had kept the facility, its largest pork plant, open in recent days over the objections of alarmed local officials.  The plant can process 19,500 hogs per day, accounting for 3.9% of U.S. pork processing capacity, according to the National Pork Board.  More than 180 infections have been linked to the plant and officials expect that number to dramatically rise. Testing of its 2,800 workers is expected to begin Friday. Cases and hospitalizations in Black Hawk County have skyrocketed in recent days and local officials say the plant is the source of most infections.  In addition to those who have tested positive for the virus, hundreds of workers were staying home out of fear, and the plant had been running at reduced production levels.  Employers have struggled to contain the virus in meatpacking plants, where workers toil side by side on production lines and often share crowded locker rooms, cafeterias and rides to work. While plants have added safety measures, public health experts say social distancing is virtually impossible.  Several facilities have temporarily closed due to virus outbreaks, including a Smithfield Foods plant in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, a JBS USA plant in Worthington, Minnesota, and a Redwood Farms Meat Processors in Estherville, Iowa. Others have stayed open or resumed production after pauses for testing and cleaning.  An estimated 25% of U.S. pork processing capacity has been closed or idled due to reduced operating speed over the past two days, said Steve Meyer, an economist with Kerns and Associates in Ames, Iowa.  As a result, prices are starting to increase and analysts warn that customers could soon see shortages of certain products at grocery stores. At the same time, hog prices are plummeting due to excess supply, devastating farmers.  In Kansas, a critical beef production state, an official said Wednesday that 168 meatpacking workers had tested positive to date. In Missouri, two rural counties that are home to several meatpacking plants reported huge spikes in infections.  Tyson Fresh Meats President Steve Stouffer said its Waterloo closure was driven by “the combination of worker absenteeism, COVID-19 cases and community concerns.” He warned of “significant ramifications” for farmers, distributors and grocers in the supply chain.  Tyson said workers would be compensated during the shutdown and that the timing of reopening would depend on several factors, including testing.  Local officials, including Waterloo Mayor Quentin Hart and the Black Hawk County Board of Health, had called on Tyson or Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds to temporarily close the plant. They had warned that its continued operation would exacerbate the spread of the virus in the area and that the company was endangering its workers.  A 65-year-old employee in the plant’s laundry department died Sunday after contracting the virus, the Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier reported.  The governor blocked local authorities from closing the plant in an April 16 order that banned social gatherings in northeastern Iowa. It granted the exclusive power to the Iowa Department of Public Health to shut down businesses over coronavirus concerns.  The governor and the department had been working with Tyson to keep the plant open.  Reynolds argued that the economic disruption caused by plant closures outweighed the health risks, warning that farmers might have to euthanize their pigs. She said that “people are gonna get” the virus in large workplaces but most will experience mild or no symptoms.  While it’s true that for most people, the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms that clear up in a few weeks, it can lead to more severe illness and even death for some, especially older adults and those with existing health problems.  Lawmakers said an earlier closure would have better protected public health and been less harmful economically. “My concern is the impact this has had because we didn’t act soon enough,” said Democratic Rep. Ras Smith of Waterloo.  The governor didn’t respond directly when asked Wednesday if the state should have intervened. She defended her overall response to the crisis but said, “There’s always more we could have done.”  Tyson resumed operations Tuesday at its pork plant in Columbus Junction, Iowa, which had been shut down for two weeks after an outbreak infected hundreds and killed two workers.",1
"My mother and I talk every day. Boulder, Colorado, which offered so much when my parents retired there, geez, more than 30 years ago, isn’t quite the jubilee it was. Now in their mid-80s, they aren’t charging up the trail to Wonderland Lake anymore.  It can be a frustrating conversation. Particularly when my mother is planning to go to the store. “Ma!” I’ll say. “Don’t risk your life for coconut shrimp!” Or, when that doesn’t work, “Ma! You’re going to die alone, surrounded by strangers in masks.”  Opinion  My father is sometimes watching television when I phone — CNN, thank God, not Fox — and my mother will mention something on the screen, the latest aftershock from our president’s daily twirl in the limelight, like some demented ballerina on the music box in an insecure girl’s nightmare.  “Don’t watch TV news, Mom,” I’ll say. “I never do.”  That’s true. Primarily because I read newspapers and follow events online, so anything on TV is repetitive. Even big breaking stories — the last time I fled to TV news was when Notre Dame burned. After 10 minutes of time-filling and tap-dancing, I bailed. What’s the point? As for the president’s daily 5 p.m. nervous breakdown ... “Fortunate the person,” Soren Kierkegaard writes, “who did not need to travel to hell in order to see what the devil looks like.”  People who do make that journey, the daily descent, feel obligated to react. This has gone on years, and I’m sorry, but by now those doing so seem merely slow on the uptake. “What? You’re saying that the president is lying?!? Oh, my gosh, that’s awful! When did he start doing that?”  And yet. Sometimes, you must join in. State the obvious. For The Record. Yes, there is something OCD about keeping track of the president’s lies. Maybe it’s like baseball; to ignore even one wild pitch is to lose the fabric of the game. I understand that. Was that a strike or a ball? Hard to determine the next day. You have to pay attention now. Though I bet journalists wish they had decided to keep track of his true statements — a much shorter list.  To the matter at hand.  On Monday, he — no need to speak the name — tweeted this:  “In light of the attack from the Invisible Enemy, as well as the need to protect the jobs of our GREAT American Citizens. I will be signing an Executive Order to temporarily suspend immigration into the United States!”  “The Invisible Enemy.” He means the virus, right? Though you can’t be certain, can you?  Three of my four grandparents were immigrants. Maybe yours, too. If they weren’t, then somebody further down the line was. And when those people came over, be they Jewish or Italian, South American or Somalian, you know the riffraff on the pier fancied themselves as better, smarter, worthier, real Americans, because they were here already.  The old lie. His ace reliever. The horse he rode in on: “They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists.” His “Look! A squirrel!” fastball. The dogs always go for it, swinging at the heels. Whenever the president has made a botch job of something — and, man, is this a botch — he winds up, lets loose “build the wall” and his followers rush off, tongues lolling.  The good news is his bad idea immediately got watered down, as it often does. By Wednesday, it was nearly meaningless, just another unwelcome fumble at Lady Liberty’s crotch. By Friday, it’ll be nearly forgotten, replaced by a dozen other doozies and head-scratchers, contradictions, excesses, whoppers and jaw-droppers.  I’m not saying ignore the news. With 45,000 Americans dead since Valentine’s Day, and another 45,000 to die, easy, by Fourth of July, that would be irresponsible.  But I recommend a conscious program of distraction. Take your news, then take a break. Wednesday, I got my hands on an advance copy of an upcoming book about Jeanne Gang, the rock star Chicago architect, and her Studio Gang. I immediately began reading — to give you a full accounting before its publication date in June, but also to go somewhere else for a little while. This year, 2020, will always be the year of COVID-19. But 2020 will also be the year Gang’s 101-story Vista Tower opens. Cold comfort, but comfort nonetheless.",1

"The researchers worked around the clock, in shifts of three to five hours, hoping to stave off weariness and keep their minds sharp for the delicate task. They set up lines of laboratory volunteers: medical residents, postdoctoral students, even experienced veterans of science, each handling a specific task. They checked and rechecked their data, as if the world were depending on it. Because in some ways, it is. For the past few weeks, more than 50 scientists have been working diligently to do something that the Food and Drug Administration mostly has not: Verifying that 14 coronavirus antibody tests now on the market actually deliver accurate results. These tests are crucial to reopening the economy, but public health experts have raised urgent concerns about their quality. The new research, completed just days ago and posted online Friday, confirmed some of those fears: Of the 14 tests, only three delivered consistently reliable results. Even the best had some flaws. The research has not been peer-reviewed and is subject to revision. But the results are already raising difficult questions about the course of the epidemic. Surveys of residents in the Bay Area, Los Angeles and New York this week found that substantial percentages tested positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the official name of the new coronavirus. In New York City, the figure was said to be as high as 21 percent. Elsewhere, it was closer to 3 percent. The idea that many residents in some parts of the country have already been exposed to the virus has wide implications. At the least, the finding could greatly complicate plans to reopen the economy. Already Americans are scrambling to take antibody tests to see if they might escape lockdowns. Public health experts are wondering if those with positive results might be allowed to return to work. But these tactics mean nothing if the test results can’t be trusted.In the new research, researchers found that only one of the tests never delivered a so-called false positive — that is, it never mistakenly signaled antibodies in people who did not have them. Two other tests did not deliver false-positive results 99 percent of the time.But the converse was not true. Even these three tests detected antibodies in infected people only 90 percent of the time, at best. The false-positive metric is particularly important. The result may lead people to believe themselves immune to the virus when they are not, and to put themselves in danger by abandoning social distancing and other protective measures. It is also the result on which scientists are most divided.“There are multiple tests that look reasonable and promising,” said Dr. Alexander Marson, an immunologist at the University of California, San Francisco, and one of the project’s leaders. “That’s some reason for optimism.” Dr. Marson is also an investigator in the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, which partly funded the study.Other scientists were less sanguine than Dr. Marson. Four of the tests produced false-positive rates ranging from 11 percent to 16 percent; many of the rest hovered around 5 percent. “Those numbers are just unacceptable,” said Scott Hensley, a microbiologist at the University of Pennsylvania. “The tone of the paper is, ‘Look how good the tests are.’ But I look at these data, and I don’t really see that.” The proportion of people in the United States who have been exposed to the coronavirus is likely to be 5 percent or less, Dr. Hensley said. “If your kit has a 3 percent false-positive, how do you interpret that? It’s basically impossible,” he said. “If your kit has 14 percent false positive, it’s useless.” Dr. Hensley said the study nonetheless was well designed and the results pressing, given the sudden proliferation of antibody tests on the market and the push to use them to lift lockdowns. “I think this is exactly the kind of study that we need right now,” he said.Dr. Marson and his colleagues said they were drawn to the study for that very reason. As universities in the Bay Area shut down all research not related to the coronavirus, some researchers began focusing on ways to improve diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2. Dr. Marson and his collaborator, Patrick Hsu, a bioengineer at the University of California, Berkeley, anticipated that antibody tests would also face questions about quality. In mid-March, Dr. Hsu heard that a friend, a venture capitalist who owns a network of 1,000 community clinics in the New York area, had ordered thousands of rapid antibody tests. Investors and entrepreneurs seemed to be distributing them around San Francisco, too. “I realized, ‘Gosh this is really the Wild West,’” Dr. Hsu said. “We needed to figure out which of these would really work.” The duo recruited Dr. Jeffrey Whitman and Dr. Caryn Bern, who last year published an analysis of antibody tests for Chagas disease. Other graduate students and postdoctoral fellows volunteered to help perform the evaluations. The team began with a modified version of the method Dr. Whitman had devised to validate Chagas tests. The researchers created a biosafety-certified space, obtained the needed approvals and procured hundreds of blood samples from two Bay Area hospitals. They also purchased tests from Chinese manufacturers, clearing customs regulations and sometimes accepting Uber deliveries in the middle of the night. In all, the investigators analyzed 10 rapid tests that deliver a yes-no signal for antibodies, and two tests using a lab technique known as Elisa that indicate the amount of antibodies present and are generally considered to be more reliable. Suited up in protective gear, the team worked in shifts of three to five hours in a sort of socially distanced factory line. One researcher spotted the test with a blood sample, and another added the necessary chemical solutions; then two independent readers looked at the test, and a last person recorded the results. Still other team members analyzed the results, sometimes working through the night. In the early hours of recent mornings, they handed the baton to Dr. Tyler Miller and his colleagues at Massachusetts General Hospital, who were conducting a slightly different analysis of three tests, including one evaluated in San Francisco. The Bay Area team finished evaluating 12 tests in record time, less than a month. By comparison, the Chagas project required a team of three people working for more than a year just to compare four tests. Having a study design already in hand helped speed the work, but there was one key difference. Decades of data have shown that Chagas disease elicits lifelong immunity. For this study, the team had no idea how quickly SARS-CoV-2 antibodies might turn up in the blood, or at what levels. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook.| Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]New tests also usually compete with an established gold standard. Lacking such a standard, the team instead compared all the tests in a “head-to-head bake-off to see who’s the winner,” Dr. Hsu said. Each test was evaluated with the same set of blood samples: from 80 people known to be infected with the coronavirus, at different points after infection; 108 samples donated before the pandemic; and 52 samples from people who were positive for other viral infections but had tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. Tests made by Sure Biotech and Wondfo Biotech, along with an in-house Elisa test, produced the fewest false positives. A test made by Bioperfectus detected antibodies in 100 percent of the infected samples, but only after three weeks of infection. None of the tests did better than 80 percent until that time period, which was longer than expected, Dr. Hsu said. The lesson is that the tests are less likely to produce false negatives the longer ago the initial infection occurred, he said. The tests were particularly variable when looking for a transient antibody that comes up soon after infection, called IgM, and more consistent in identifying a subsequent antibody, called IgG, that may signal longer-term immunity. “You can see that antibody levels rise at different points for every patient,” Dr. Hsu said. The tests performed best when the researchers assessed both types of antibodies together. None of the tests could say whether the presence of these antibodies means a person is protected from reinfection, however. The results overall are promising, Dr. Marson added. “There are multiple tests that have specificities greater than 95 percent.” Rapid antibody tests are generally used to get a simple yes-no result, but the team assigned the positive results — which appear as bands on a test strip — a score from zero to six. They trained readers to interpret those results, and found their decisions often agreed and were supported by the more quantitative Elisa tests. “If you train the readers well, they can start to be reliable,” Dr. Marson said of rapid tests. “That is critical to understand if these tests could ever be deployed.” The team at Mass General set a higher bar for specificity; they considered a score of one for the intensity of a band to be a negative result, rather than a score of zero. Perhaps because they eliminated the fainter bands — the ones most likely to be erroneous — their estimate of specificity for BioMedomics, the one test that was evaluated by both teams, was more than 99 percent, compared with the San Francisco team’s estimate of 87 percent. Other experts were skeptical of the scoring approach, however. “That’s not really a method that would give you a real quantitation,” said Florian Krammer of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. Dr. Krammer has developed a two-step Elisa test that he said has 100 percent specificity and delivers a measure of the quantity of IgM and IgG antibodies a person has. Scoring a rapid test’s bands might offer some data for a scientific study, he said, “but I would not make any decisions based on that.” Dr. Krammer said false positives are less of an issue for assessing how widely the virus has spread in the population. If a test has a known false-positive rate, scientists can factor that into their calculations, he said. But false positives become dangerous when making policy and personal decisions about who can go back to work. “You don’t want anybody back to work who has a false positive — that’s the last thing you want to do,” Dr. Krammer said. Scanwell Health, a Los Angeles-based start-up, has ordered millions of test kits from Innovita, a Chinese manufacturer, and has applied to the Food and Drug Administration to market the tests for at-home use. In the new study, the Innovita test detected antibodies in 83 percent of infected people and yielded a false-positive rate of 4 percent. Dr. Jack Jeng, chief medical officer of Scanwell Health, said the study looked at an earlier version of Innovita’s test and not the “newer, improved version” his company had ordered. “It will be interesting to see how it performs,” he said. Dr. Marson and his colleagues have acquired tests from nearly 100 manufacturers, and plan to continue comparing them. The scientists also hope to expand their sample set to include people who were mildly ill or did not feel ill at all, and to stratify their data by age and the presence of chronic conditions. “This is just the beginning,” Dr. Marson said. “Our goal would be to keep going till we feel there’s adequate supply in the market.”",1
"If you're planning to visit Earth in the year 2020, it's important to be wearing a face mask to protect yourself from the coronavirus. And apparently the rule doesn't only apply to humans — an asteroid speeding toward Earth appears to know about the pandemic and is sporting a face mask of its own.  An asteroid called 52768 (1998 OR2) will zoom past Earth next week. Astronomers at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico are tracking the asteroid, and couldn't help but notice a familiar silhouette after capturing a new radar view of the object.  ""The small-scale topographic features such as hills and ridges on one end of asteroid 1998 OR2 are fascinating scientifically,"" research scientist Anne Virkki said in a press release Thursday. ""But since we are all thinking about COVID-19 these features make it look like 1998 OR2 remembered to wear a mask.""  A team at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico took this range-Doppler radar image of Asteroid 1998OR2 on April 17. University of Florida  But don't worry — the asteroid has no chance of becoming infected with the virus.  Arecibo data confirmed that 1998 OR2 is about 1.2 miles across and rotates approximately once every four hours. Scientists at NASA's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies said it will make its closest approach to Earth on April 29, but it will still be 16 times farther away than the moon — nearly four million miles.  1998 OR2 is classified as a Potentially Hazardous Object, which are larger than 500 feet and come within 5 million miles of Earth's orbit. After its discovery, NASA said it is ""large enough to cause global effects"" if it impacted Earth, but poses no threat to the planet.  And it won't be the only time the asteroid pays Earth a visit. And next time, it'll come a little closer.  ""The radar measurements allow us to know more precisely where the asteroid will be in the future, including its future close approaches to Earth,"" says Flaviane Venditti, a research scientist at the observatory. ""In 2079, asteroid 1998 OR2 will pass Earth about 3.5 times closer than it will this year, so it is important to know its orbit precisely.""  Arecibo said that scientists continue to monitor asteroids for planetary defense purposes, but are following proper social distancing guidelines and wearing masks while making observations.",1
"After spending about $25 million on the project, British technology company Dyson says the UK government doesn’t need the ventilator it developed to help treat COVID-19 patients, Reuters reported. The company, best known for its vacuum cleaners, said last month it had an order from the UK government for 10,000 of the breathing machines and developed one it called the CoVent.  Dyson was awaiting regulatory approval for the design of the CoVent, reportedly built in 10 days using the company’s existing motor technology. The bed-mounted, portable ventilator is able to run on battery power if necessary.  Ventilators are needed to treat critically ill COVID-19 patients, many of whom suffer from severe respiratory symptoms. Other companies— including GM, Ford, and Tesla—shifted to developing ventilators over the past several weeks as demand for the devices increased.  James Dyson, the company founder, said he did not regret the time and resources put into the ventilator effort. “Mercifully they are not required,” he said in a statement adding, “I have some hope that our ventilator may yet help the response in other countries, but that requires further time and investigation.”",1

Our goal is to provide you with insight and analysis about the big stories of the day.  Thanks as always for reading. Please feel free to reply to this email and tell us what you like or don't like, and we'll evolve and improve as we go.  —Henry Blodget (henry@insider.com) and David Plotz (david@insider.com)  SUMMARY: Yes, we'll waste billions and risk lives in a fast search for a coronavirus vaccine — but it's worth it. More corroboration for the Biden sexual-assault allegation. College presidents are right: Colleges need to open in the fall. Open the parks and beaches! Stop judging people who go outside! Biden to announce a ""committee"" to evaluate VP candidates? Come on!  Yes, let's waste billions of dollars — and even risk lives — in the search for a coronavirus vaccine. This is the best and fastest way to find one.  A lab technician working on samples from people to be tested for the new coronavirus at ""Fire Eye"" laboratory in Wuhan in China's central Hubei Province. Getty  Insider's Bill Bostock reports that the world's largest vaccine maker is going to manufacture 40 million doses of a COVID-19 vaccine candidate this summer, even though the vaccine hasn't been tested yet, might not be safe, or might not work. That's great news.  This is just one of what promise to be many apparently wasteful and risky attempts to create a vaccine — most of which will fail. Other pharma and biotech firms like Johnson & Johnson and Moderna are similarly ramping up vaccine manufacturing, before they know if the shots will work.  Bill Gates has proposed spending billions of dollars to build multiple vaccine-manufacturing plants to scale up production of seven different untested vaccines, though only one is likely to be effective. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) is going to spend $2 billion to accelerate production of several vaccine candidates, most of which will likely go to waste.  Others propose to risk human lives to speed up vaccine testing. Some leading scientists want to launch ""human challenge"" trials for coronavirus vaccines. In these trials, volunteers would be given experimental vaccines or a placebo and then deliberately exposed to the coronavirus.  This would massively accelerate knowledge about whether the vaccine works, because we wouldn't have to wait months to see if the test subjects contract the disease in the normal course of life. But some of the volunteer subjects would also fall ill — especially if it's a placebo trial — and given how terrible COVID-19 is, some would likely die. This is also especially worrying in the current context because we have no effective treatment to help those who do get sick.  Wasting money and potentially harming people obviously aren't good. But, right now, the risks are worth it. That's because our enemy is time.  The normal processes of pharmaceutical research — manufacturing only when you know a drug works, and only testing in the safest ways — make sense in normal situations. But every day we don't have a vaccine, thousands die, billions of dollars in economic activity are lost, and human welfare declines. Our future selves become poorer and sicker.  So there is literally almost nothing we shouldn't try to get us a vaccine quicker, even if that means building factories that make vaccines that don't work and conducting potentially deadly trials on volunteers. —DP  More corroboration for the Biden sexual-assault allegation from the '90s  We now have more corroboration of the sexual-assault allegation against then-Sen. Biden in 1993.  Rich McHugh writes in Insider that a neighbor of Tara Reade, the former Biden staffer who recently filed a criminal complaint accusing him of assaulting her in a hallway, has come forward to corroborate her story.  The neighbor, Lynda LaCasse, says Reade told her about the alleged incident in 1995 or 1996, a few years after Reade says it occurred. LaCasse said Reade shared with her many of the same details that Reade has recently alleged.  LaCasse says Reade did not ask her to come forward now. She adds that she is a Democrat and plans to vote for Biden. She says she came forward because she believes it was the right thing to do.  A second corroborator, Lorraine Sanchez, was a colleague of Reade's in a California state senator's office after she left Washington DC. Sanchez says Reade told her that her former boss in Washington had harassed her. Sanchez did not recall whether Reade went into detail.  Biden's campaign has said Reade's allegation is false. Biden himself has not commented on it. He's going to have to.  Read Rich McHugh's latest report here.  College presidents are right: Colleges need to open in the fall  The Purdue marching band. Chris T Pehlivan / Shutterstock.com  Crowded parties, football stadiums, dorms, lecture halls … colleges are paradise for a zealous coronavirus, which is why they all shut down, and fast, in March. But most universities and colleges can't afford to stay closed for long. They carry huge faculty and staff costs, and own expensive physical plants.  Colleges also depend on tuition to pay their bills. And most can't simply transition to remote learning, because students won't stand for it. They're paying for the college experience, for working together in labs and studios, living together in dorms.  So it's expected — and encouraging — that we're now seeing a rush of college presidents pushing bold ideas about how to reopen in the fall, even without a coronavirus vaccine or treatment.  In an inspiring letter, president Mitch Daniels said Purdue University is ""determined not to surrender helplessly to those [COVID-19] difficulties but to tackle and manage them aggressively and creatively."" Daniels argues that the virus is not an intolerable risk for the young. He proposes to test everyone in August, reopen campus for those under 35 years old, segregate those older than 35 or at particular risk from the general population, and track and contact trace the infected.  Will it work? Who knows? But it's heartening to see this kind of practical problem-solving from one of the world's greatest engineering schools. We're not going to learn how to live with the virus without some creative, even unorthodox thinking, and it makes sense to use universities — which are the front lines of American research, after all — as laboratories.  For example, Brown University president Christina Paxson acknowledges that reopening colleges will almost certainly require using technology that infringes on civil liberties to vigorously track students and faculty. That seems like an infringement worth a test, and no better place to try it out than in the limited space of a campus.  What Purdue president Daniels doesn't say is that the decision by some schools to reopen will put pressure on other schools, since no college will want to risk losing its students to rivals that have reopened. But not every college will have the resources to test and track in the way Purdue or Brown can, so there will definitely be campus COVID-19 clusters in the fall. —DP  Open the parks and beaches! Stop judging people who go outside!  Fort Greene Park on April 23, 2020, in the Clinton Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. Mike Lawrie/Getty Images  As pressure builds for lockdowns to be relaxed or dropped, it's time to get more sophisticated about which measures actually have a big effect on slowing the coronavirus and which don't.  Concentrating our efforts on measures that really matter, while giving us more freedom by relaxing those that don't, will enable us to keep the crucial tactics in place for longer.  So here's a suggestion:  Relax restrictions that encourage or compel people to stay indoors.  The virus spreads primarily by droplets getting from one infected person's nose and mouth to another person's, in sufficient quantities and duration to cause an infection. Sunlight kills the virus quickly, and wind disperses it. Studies suggest that transmission almost exclusively occurs indoors.  As Insider's Anna Medaris Miller explains, experts are confident that being outside is low risk, especially when you are properly distanced. When you're distanced and wearing a mask, in fact, it would take something amounting to a ""freak accident"" for you to catch the virus or infect someone else outside, even if you passed close by each other.  A new study from China underscores this. It looked at 318 ""outbreaks"" that involved three or more cases. Not a single one of these infections occurred outdoors. (Most of them occurred within homes, with one family member infecting others. It has another important implication for more sophisticated distancing measures — namely, creating isolation and quarantine facilities outside of homes — but we'll leave that for another day.)  In a broader look at 7,324 cases, in fact, the researchers found only one case in which infection appears to have occurred outdoors. It involved two people in a village who had a conversation after one of them returned from a visit to Wuhan.  To be clear: It's not impossible to catch or transmit the virus outside. But it's rare. And with minimal precautions — some distancing and a mask — it should be extremely rare.  Meanwhile, going outside has all sorts of psychological and physiological benefits, including allowing us to feel more free and less trapped. As Anna Medaris Miller posits, even experts who fully support distancing measures believe that these benefits offset the risks. Respected Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch — who generally supports strict distancing measures — believes there is a net benefit to keeping open spaces open.  So open the parks!  And go outside! —HB  Everyone's eager to know who VP Biden will choose as his running mate.  Instead of just making the decision and then telling us the answer, however, Biden reportedly plans to first announce the selection of a ""committee"" who will evaluate the candidates.  Yes, the Trump habit of dismissing experts and making impulsive decisions with minimal consideration based on his own ""gut instinct"" leads to imprecision and mistakes. And, yes, the country is suffering for this.  But announcing a committee to evaluate potential VP candidates is going too far the other way.  Of course Biden should have a team evaluate prospective candidates. But he doesn't need to announce in advance who these people are. He also doesn't need to remind Americans that Democrats have a reputation for being overly bureaucratic in their decision-making. —HB",1
"LOS ANGELES — Grammy-nominated gospel singer Troy Sneed has died from complications with the coronavirus. He was 52.  Sneed’s publicist Bill Carpenter said the singer died early Monday at a hospital in Jacksonville, Florida. Sneed earned a Grammy nomination for his work on the Youth For Christ’s 1999 album “Higher.”  Sneed traveled throughout the United States early in his career to sing the gospel with the Georgia Mass Choir. He arranged music on their albums and appeared with the choir in the 1996 film “The Preacher’s Wife,” starring Whitney Houston and Denzel Washington.  Sneed helped form Youth For Christ, which was comprised of members between the ages of 12 and 18 from the Georgia Mass Choir. He served as a producer on Youth For Christ’s “The Struggle Is Over,” which landed at No. 1 on Billboard’s gospel songs chart in 2006.  As a solo artist, Sneed released seven albums and had several hit songs within the gospel realm including “Work It Out” and “My Heart Says Yes,” which both peaked at No. 2 on Billboard’s gospel chart. He’s also known for the upbeat “Hallelujah.”  Sneed and his wife, Emily, started their own record label Emtro, which is a blend of their first names. Their label became a success with a roster of artists from Alvin Darling & Celebration and Rev. Rudolph McKissick.",1
"Chicago Police have cited the owner of a townhome that was the site of a large house party over the weekend, according to a Northwest Side alderman.  Ald. Gilbert Villegas (36th) said he convened a Monday meeting between the building owner and the commander of the CPD’s Grand Central District, who issued the woman “a couple citations for public nuisance and gave her strict warnings and we also have just put her on notice.”  Video footage of the weekend party in the 2000 block of North Narragansett quickly went viral. Clips posted to Facebook showed dozens of people crammed into the home, with everyone standing in very close proximity and hardly anyone wearing protective masks.  Villegas — Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s floor leader in City Council — said the party was the doing of the building owner’s adult son. The owner’s son had a set of keys to the building and was able to disarm the home’s alarm system. It was the second party he’s thrown in the building in recent weeks, Villegas said.  The home, in Chicago’s Galewood community, is in Villegas’ ward.  Earlier in the day, Lightfoot vowed to “get to the bottom” of the party — and hold everyone involved accountable for the public health risk.  Lightfoot said the city is “still in the midst of the investigation to identify the specific location” of the party, captured on a shocking Facebook video that already had been viewed more than a million times before it was taken down Monday.  The party is believed to have taken place somewhere on the West Side, but City Hall is still “nailing down specifics,” she said.  The mayor argued “everybody involved” in the party “bears a level of responsibility” and will ultimately be held accountable.  “When you see a scene like that where you have, literally, it looked to me, like hundreds of people gathered in a small, confined space literally cheek-to-jowl like that, it goes against all of the things we’ve been talking about. All of the things that the vast majority of Chicagoans understand and know,” the mayor said.  “They put themselves at risk. But not only that. Every single person there who put themselves at risk puts the next person and the next person that they come into contact with at risk. That’s why, for me, that scene is so distressing. But, we’ll get to the bottom of it.”  Lightfoot pointed to “Zoom chats” and other opportunities for young people to connect using social media. She said the city plans to “step up and do a lot over the course of the summer, depending on where we are in the arc of this virus” and how much the stay-at-home order is relaxed. But she argued a shortage of organized teen activities is no excuse to flout the statewide, stay-at-home order.  “What happened in that scene was just foolish and reckless. There’s got to be a level of personal responsibility for that. Millenials aren’t children. Millenials—many of `em—are in their 20’s. They’re fully functioning adults. And we expect adults to act responsibly—particularly at a time of pandemic,” the mayor said.  Videographer Tink Purcell captured the chaotic Saturday night party scene from halfway up a staircase and streamed it live on Facebook for about 24 minutes.  Some partygoers were wearing face masks, but most were not. Social distancing was out the window as those in attendance danced and drank elbow-to-elbow while lines formed at the front door and on the stairs.  The mayor was asked how she plans to prevent similarly unauthorized house parties as temperatures rise and cabin fever builds.  “I can’t prevent people from being foolish. I wish I had that kind of power. What we can do ... is educate people about why taking those kinds of risks are unnecessary and foolish, talk about personal responsibility and then, where we see it, take decisive action and make sure that we shut it down,” Lightfoot said.  “I have no compunction about setting the appropriate example in egregious situations like we saw. Not just in that event, but there were several other large-scale parties that the police department was called upon to break up over the weekend. We’re not gonna set the standard for the summer and warmer weather by allowing people to flout all the public health guidance we’ve been giving.”",1
"The CDC recommends wearing a face mask that covers your nose and mouth when leaving your home for essentials like groceries and prescriptions. Some types of masks are not intended for reuse, but there are a few things you can do to sanitize them, upgrade filtration and extend their lives. Here are some strategies that will help you get the most out of your mask, and keep you and your family safe.  Let's say you just got back from the grocery store wearing your mask. Now what?  1. Treat your mask like a biohazard.  Isolate it from the rest of your family. “You don't want to be leaving it on the kitchen counter or the coffee table where other people may inadvertently be handling it,” says Kirsten Koehler, an associate professor of environmental health and engineering at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.  2. Wash your hands with soap every time you remove or even touch the mask.  Act as if the virus is on both sides of the fabric. Make sure to wash your hands properly for at least 20 seconds.  Those are coronavirus mask basics.  There’s much more to know, though, if you want to extend the life of your gear or even make your own mask.  How to clean homemade cloth face masks and the best material to make one  To clean your mask, run it through the washing machine and dryer after use. The water doesn't necessarily needs to be hot but make sure to use a laundry detergent.  If you don't have access to a washing machine, you can hand-wash using soap. Another option: Put the mask into a paper bag and leave it in a warm place for at least two days. After that, the virus will become inactive and won’t be infectious.  When you are wearing a homemade mask, you should keep in mind that you are not wearing the mask to protect yourself, but to minimize the spread of virus particles to others. Even if you feel no effects, you may be asymptomatic.  Homemade masks are less effective at protecting the wearer because most have voids, or spaces near your nose and cheeks where the tiny droplets can be inhaled, and the pores in the fabric alone are generally not small enough to trap tiny aerosolized droplets.  Some materials make better masks than than others. According to a study published in Disaster Medicine and Public Health Preparedness, homemade masks made from a kitchen towel proved to be the most effective at removing particles.  On the other hand, T-shirts or pillowcases may be the best choice as they can provide a better fit by stretching. Avoid using old fabrics because washing and drying may stretch the pores, allowing more particles to get in.  The choice of fabric is very important. Professor Koehler suggests using tightly woven fabric folded in multiple layers. A research paper published in PeerJ confirms the fabric concern. The study looked at the surface of 20 different types of cloth masks and found the size of pores in masks ranged from 80 to 500 micrometers. For comparison, the novel coronavirus is about 0.12 micrometers:  You may also want to avoid thick materials like vacuum cleaner bags. A material with high resistance will force air to escape through routes around the mask fabric creating a void. Also, breathing through a thick mask can be tough on your heart and lungs. This could put elderly people and those with preexisting cardiopulmonary conditions at risk.  ""It shouldn't be so difficult that you just can't physically breathe, but you should notice some resistance in your breathing,"" Dr. Koehler said. ""Otherwise your mask is probably not doing anything.""  Adding any sort of filtering inside the mask may help to reinforce it and add additional protection. An engineer specializing in aerodynamics has tested the effectiveness of paper towels. A single layer captured 23% of particles 0.3 microns or larger. Adding an extra layer increased particle capture to 33%.  Phillip Clapp, a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Environmental Medicine, Asthma, and Lung Biology at the University of North Carolina, has been testing various homemade masks. When he studied three layers of cotton fabric, he saw that the material itself had efficiency of around 90%. However, once he wore the mask made from that material, its efficiency dropped below 50%.  ""And what that tells us is that it really has to do with how well that mask will fit your face, as to how well you'll be protected,"" Dr. Clapp said.  The mask should cover both your nose and mouth. The CDC has published several tutorials on making face masks, which include masks with elastic ear loops as well as tie strings. If you choose to make a mask with tie strings, it's important to make sure the straps fit correctly around the head so the mask does not fall down.  When wearing a mask, secure the bottom ties first with a bow around the nape of your neck. Then, pull the mask by the upper ties over your mouth and chin and secure around your head.  Preliminary results from a study by researchers at Northeastern University show that sewn fabric masks can in some cases approach the filtration efficiency of commercially produced masks.  Adding an elastic outer layer improved fit for all mask types tested. Particularly helpful was adding an outer layer made from nylon stockings. Even surgical masks were found to perform better with stockings during the study.  You should not clean an N95 mask at home. But you can reuse it with proper care. Here's how:  The general public is asked not to purchase N95 respirators due to shortages in the medical supply. But if you have one, they offer good protection. The key with the N95 respirator is proper fit: There should be no air gaps or voids around the nose, cheeks or chin.  According to Koehler, some data suggests that the virus could live on N95 respirators up to seven days, as opposed to about two days for the cloth fabrics.  She recommends using a method that isolates the mask in a breathable location:  Never use cleaning products such as Lysol, alcohol or bleach. Liquid, including soap and water, can damage the mesh of electrically charged fibers designed to catch particles and droplets.  Can you use expired face masks and respirators?  Expired N95 respirators remain as effective as the new ones, Clapp said. He tested respirators that were as far as 11 years behind the expiration date. While the respirator may still filter particles as good as new, elastic bands that may deteriorate.  Can you clean and reuse disposable surgical masks? Sort of. Here's how:  Surgical masks are intended to protect the wearer’s face from large droplets and splashes of blood and other body fluids. Efficiency of surgical mask filters can range from less than 10% to nearly 90% depending on the manufacturer and the type of the mask. According to Clapp, surgical masks with ear loops (38.9% effective) performed worse than surgical masks with tie strings (71.5% effective.)  Generally, surgical masks are less effective than N95 respirators because they don’t provide a seal around the nose and mouth, which could allow smaller droplets to get in. At the same time, studies show that they are better than homemade masks at protecting from larger particles.  Ana Rule, an assistant professor of environmental health and engineering at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, recommends not buying surgical masks to ensure enough supply for health care workers. Wear one only if you have it already at home.  How to reuse: The best strategy is to isolate it for a week in a breathable container such as a paper bag. Putting masks in the plastic may lead to accumulation of moisture and development of bacteria. Surgical masks should not be washed, because liquid damages the filter.  How to clean and reuse elastomeric respirators  When elastomeric respirators are properly fit tested and worn, they can provide the user with an effective face seal and will hold up to repeated use, cleaning and maintenance. As with N95 masks, use only if you already have one.  How to clean and reuse the respirator: Wipe down with alcohol swabs to disinfection after each use. The attached filter cartridges are replaceable and are easily changed. Though they can be reused, their life span depends on many factors such as exposure and concentration of particles. It's important to double check if the cartridges you have are designated for filtering coronavirus particles.  Using masks in the family  The best practice is just for one person within a family to go to a store or other places where it might be difficult to maintain social distancing. Parents should ensure that children don't touch their face, because wearing the mask may encourage them to do so. CDC recommends that children under 2 years old shouldn't wear the mask because of the risk of suffocation.",1
"Putin extends isolation as Russia ranked 8th in Covid-19 cases  Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a new extension of “non-working days” that were declared nationwide in order to combat the spread of coronavirus infection COVID-19. Without waiting for the expiration of the previous deadline (April 30), Putin announced that all days through May 11 would be non-working days in Russia.  Traditionally, Russians celebrate May holidays from May 1 till May 9 with just a few working days between them. Many prefer to take a few days off to spend a full-fledged ten-day vacation to spend it either abroad or working in gardens.  Putin explained the need to prolong the tough measures to combat COVID-19 with the fact that the epidemic in Russia has not reached its peak yet.  “We are now facing a new, perhaps the most intense stage of the fight against the epidemic. All of us will need utmost composure, discipline and mobilization. We must make sure that the wave of the epidemic subsides and finally declines,” Putin said.  Anna Popova, the head of Rospotrebnadzor (environmental watchdog), noted that during the new period of non-working days one should maintain the self-isolation regime and other restrictions.  “This is the third incubation period for the entire period of non-working days that should interrupt the chain of transmission of the virus,” Popova said.  She said earlier that stringent restrictions need to be extended for at least another two weeks.  “We can’t stop halfway. So far, we have been in the phase of severe restrictive measures for only two incubation periods for this disease. In order to stop the spread of the virus and be completely sure that we will pass the point of no return, this is absolutely not enough,” Popova said.  On March 25, in his televised address to the nation in connection with the fight against the spread of coronavirus infection COVID-19, the president declared a non-working week from March 30 to April 5. On April 2, the president made a new appeal to the nation, having extended the non-working regime until April 30.  On April 28, it became known that Russia left Iran behind and took the 8th place in the world in the number of officially registered patients with COVID-19. As of April 27, 93,558 cases of COVID-19 were recorded in the country (+6411 over the last 24 hours), 867 people died.",0
"IHG, Four Seasons, Omni and Caesars joined the growing list of hospitality companies updating cleanliness measures due to the new coronavirus. Short-term rental company Vrbo followed suit, too.  IHG, owner of hotel chains like InterContinental and Holiday Inn, followed many major hotel companies by announcing new cleanliness measures on May 18, in conjunction with Cleveland Clinic medical experts and Ecolab and Diversey hygiene experts. The in-progress changes may include hotel-wide extra deep-cleaning of high-touch surfaces, ""last cleaned"" charts and social distancing practices. Additional guidance for hotels may include Other changes might be individual amenity cleaning kits for guests, plus hand sanitizer and disinfecting wipes in guest rooms.  Four Seasons is partnering with Johns Hopkins Medicine International for its new global health and safety program, ""Lead With Care."" The program notes that public areas will be cleaned hourly, with extra attention to areas like the front desk counters and public restrooms; kits with masks, hand sanitizer and sanitization wipes will be in each guest room; and restaurants and bars might operate at a limited capacity for social distancing purposes, among other initiatives.  Omni's ""Safe & Clean"" initiative includes a daily health screening for employees, with a temperature check. The company is expanding its use of Environmental Protection Agency- and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-approved disinfectants. Omni is increasing the cleaning of its heating and cooling systems and replacing air filters more often. High-traffic areas will become one-way where possible. Single-use items will be placed in guest rooms, and a limited-contact check-in and check-out process will become standard.  Caesars Entertainment is assuring guests its employees are well-versed in cleaning and disinfectant practices, which includes PPE use. Multiple handwashing stations have been added to the resort, and both slot machine banks and table games will allow for social distancing going forward, among other changes.  Accor 'ALLSAFE' plan includes temperature checks; partnership brings in telemedicine consultants  Accor's ""ALLSAFE"" plan, in addition to heightened cleanliness procedures, will include temperature checks for guests and partitions at front desks. For an extra health measure, as soon as July 2020 guests will also have free access to telemedicine consultants and have access to tens of thousands of medical professionals. Accor is working with insurance company AXA Partners.  MGM Resorts: Minimize drinking, no eating on the casino floor  MGM launched its ""Seven-Point Safety Plan,"" a new standard created with medical and scientific experts to curb the spread of coronavirus, respond to possible new cases and keep customers and employees safe.  In addition to upgraded incident response protocols and contactless check-in, some of the company's focuses will be:  Screening, temperature checks and employee training: Employees will be screened for signs and symptoms of infection, and will continue to go through temperature checks. Guests are encouraged to adhere to CDC guidelines for self-quarantine and to not travel if they think they have been exposed.  Mandatory masks and PPE: Employees will be given an approved mask to wear when on the property, and guests are encouraged to wear masks in public areas. Free masks will be offered to guests who need one. Guests should limit the amount of time they are drinking on the casino floor and should not eat there.  Physical distancing: Floor guides will be throughout properties making sure people adhere to six-foot distancing. But MGM is aware distancing could prove difficult. ""From time-to-time, six-foot distancing will be challenging – and in those cases, reasonable mitigating protocols will be implemented, such as plexiglass barriers or eye protection for employees,"" according to the new policy.  Hand washing and enhanced sanitization: On top of enhanced cleaning, MGM will deploy electrostatic sprayers for more efficient disinfecting. Hand washing and sanitizing stations will also be available in high-traffic spots, along with signage.  HVAC controls and air quality: MGM has worked to minimize risk of virus transmission with HVAC systems. HVAC systems will be reviewed and adjusted pending science and government guidance.  Red Roof's RediClean initiative launches  The budget hotel chain launched Red Roof RediClean, an enhanced cleanliness program to bolster guests' confidence to stay there again.  Red Roof is asking its staff to be thorough when cleaning guest rooms (i.e. sanitizing TVs, doorknobs, light switches, faucets, etc.), and staff is sanitizing common areas like elevators, laundry rooms and front desks up to four times each day.  The company has made signage explaining guests need to wear a face covering in public spaces, per government rules. If local or state governments require facial coverings in common areas where social distancing is more difficult — think laundry rooms or indoor hallways — guests must adhere to that mandate. They are encouraged to do so (with signage) in states not requiring this.  Wyndham: 'Count on Us'  Wyndham, which has more than 6,000 hotels in the U.S., announced a new initiative called ""Count on Us"", which includes updated cleaning and disinfection procedures for guest rooms and public spaces, plus easy access to health essentials.  The chain will ship products including face masks for hotel employees, disinfectant wipes for guests and hand sanitizer. Wyndham is also set to partner with Ecolab to use its disinfectants across guest rooms and public spaces.  Best Western announces 'We Care Clean' plan  Meanwhile, Best Western's rejiggered ""We Care Clean"" plan includes enhanced sanitization procedures at the front desk and lobby, upgraded grab and go breakfast offerings in most hotels and offered more strict cleaning of public amenities like pools and fitness centers.  The hotel brand is relying on guidance from the CDC, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the EPA and Health Canada.  Sandals rolls out 'Platinum Protocols of Cleanliness'  Sandals and Beaches Resorts, which has 24 properties in seven countries, has its own new sanitation rules. The chain's Platinum Protocols of Cleanliness Program will include precautionary temperature checks, personal anti-bacterial hand towels and individual in-room hand sanitizer, according to Sandals spokesperson Rachael Salzer. Each hotel room will be maintained using UV-LED lighting equipment to inspect cleanliness, air duct sanitization for each arrival and upon each departure and weekly carpet steam-cleaning.  Vrbo  Vrbo, part of Expedia Group, has issued guidelines informed by the CDC , the World Health Organization and Cristal International Standards. Dr. Daniel Lucey, from the Infectious Diseases Society of America, advised the company. There are directives for disinfecting surfaces, ensuring time between bookings and keeping homes stocked with antibacterial hand soaps and hand sanitizers.  Homeowners and property managers will have the ability to report whether guests can check in and out without person-to-person contact or if the property can't accommodate 24 hours between guests. Guests will be able to see this information on the Vrbo app and website once hosts detail the information to the company.  The company is also offering a flexible cancellation search filter.  Hyatt aims to introduce new cleanliness accreditation process  Hyatt announced cleanliness measures last week, announcing it is relying on medical experts, industry professionals and others to ensure guests feel safe.  ""We must critically examine the hotel experience from every vantage point – from our rooms and our lobbies to our spas and dining – bringing in the latest research, technology and innovation to make that happen,"" Mark Hoplamazian, Hyatt president and CEO, said in a statement.  By September, every Hyatt hotel is expected to have someone trained as a ""hygiene manager,"" who will make sure their hotel adheres to new guidelines.  These may include social distancing guidelines, prominent hand sanitizer placement, food safety and hygiene protocol implementation for restaurants and room service and increased cleaning frequency with hospital-grade disinfectants on high-touch surfaces, shared spaces and in guest rooms.  Hyatt is also developing new work procedures and trainings for its employees to address their safety and the safety of guests. This includes daily surveys that will assess colleague comfort, hotel cleanliness and more.  The company also aims to introduce a new accreditation process in May from the Global Biorisk Advisory Council across hundreds of hotels; Hyatt says it is the first to do so. This council, made up of leaders in the microbial-pathogenic threat analysis and mitigation space, is a division of ISSA, the global cleaning industry association.  Hyatt has been working with infectious disease and occupational health experts to develop the program.  As individual hotel chains, including Hyatt, Hilton and Marriott, announce their cleaning initiatives during the coronavirus pandemic, the industry at large is also working to implement to new standards to make guests feel safe.  The American Hotel & Lodging Association (AHLA) unveiled its Safe Stay guidelines on May 4, an effort made in conjunction with major brands like Hilton, Marriott and Best Western to standardize cleanliness.  ""It's really an effort to make sure that no matter if you're staying at an extended-stay economy hotel or you're staying at the nicest luxury resort, that there will be at a minimum common standards across the entire industry,"" Chip Rogers, AHLA president and CEO, told USA TODAY.  The report outlines baseline hotel practices and procedures (you can find the full guidelines here) meant to protect employees and guests.  Hilton's new cleaning protocols  Hilton also said this week that it is partnering with the company behind Lysol, as well as the Mayo Clinic, to better ensure cleanliness in its hotels. The new program will be called ""Hilton CleanStay"" and aims to to give guests peace of mind when staying at a Hilton property, whether they are in guest rooms, restaurants, the gym or other public areas.  Full details are being ironed out, but several initiatives in development include:  An official room seal indicating that a room hasn't been accessed after a deep cleaning  The removal of pen, paper and guest directories in favor of a digital option (or available on request)  Contactless check-in, where guests can complete check-in and check-out processes via a mobile app and receive a digital room key (Hilton Honors members already have access to digital keys)  Electrostatic sprayers and ultraviolet light to be used in the sanitization process  Marriott updates cleaning procedures  Marriott said it will use electrostatic sprayers with hospital-grade disinfectants to sanitize throughout its hotels. In addition to guest rooms, the sprayers will be used in lobbies, gyms and other public areas. It said the cleaning agents used would be those recommended by the CDC and Prevention and the WHO to kill all known pathogens.  In addition, the company is testing ultraviolet light technology for sanitizing room keys and adding hand sanitizer stations and signs in the lobby to remind anyone who enters to keep their distance from others. Marriott is also taking a look at what to do at properties that offer buffet service.  Choice Hotels starts 'Commitment to Clean' program  Choice Hotels, too, announced a new cleaning program, which will focus on furniture arrangement to promote social distancing, stronger cleaning protocols for higher-traffic areas like front desks and personal protective equipment for hotel staff.  The ""Commitment to Clean"" program will involve the chain working with Ecolab and guidance from the CDC, WHO , U.S. Travel Association and AHLA's Safe Stay Advisory Council.  Airbnb issues cleaning recommendations  Airbnb is establishing a new recommended ""cleaning protocol"" with the goal of reassuring both rental property hosts and their guests.  For hosts, the guidelines will offer recommendations for personal protective gear, such as masks and gloves, while cleaning. Rentals will be spaced out by 24 hours for hosts who have opted in to the cleaning protocols, and hosts will have the option of an online feature that automatically prevents bookings less than 72 hours apart for an extra measure of safety.  Turnkey introduces coronavirus cleaning tips  The vacation rental service announced updates to its GuestWorks cleaning system and verification technology to best combat coronavirus. Prior to the pandemic, TurnKey was already using a housekeeping scheduler, keyless locks and in-home tablet, among other amenities, and had eliminated the need for in-person communication.  Now the system will be upgraded with updated checklists to help housekeepers disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as doorknobs, handles and light switches. In the cleaning system's app, housekeepers will have to confirm and verify through a photo the use of COVID-19-eliminating products.  It will require a 24-hour period between guest stays in May and June of this year and will extend this if necessary. Housekeepers and home inspections by TurnKey staff are permissible between stays, however.

"The Latino community in Illinois has surpassed African Americans in confirmed cases of the coronavirus and could have the greatest number of patients among all races and ethnic groups within days.  As of Thursday, the Illinois Department of Public Health reported 12,276 cases where the patient is white, 11,848 among Latinos, and 11,353 in the black community.  Last week, on April 22, there were about 7,800 patients who were white, 5,800 who identified as Latino and 8,100 who were African American.  The dramatic rise in cases among Latinos is reflective of better testing capabilities and greater awareness of COVID-19 symptoms, but public health experts are raising concerns about the state’s reach among Latino communities in their efforts to contain the pandemic.  “The trend that we’re seeing is that cases among the Latino community are doubling at a faster rate than everyone else, but the response has been limited in those emerging hotspots,” said Aida Giachello, a medical sociologist at Northwestern University and member of the Illinois Latino Covid-19 Initiative, a community outreach group.  “We want sufficient attention and resources to tackle the virus in our community. We need better messaging on what to do if you contract the virus and how to protect others, especially in Spanish.”  Of the coronavirus cases where a patient’s race and ethnicity was reported, 31% are white, 29% are black and 30% are Latino, according to the state health department. About a quarter of the state’s nearly 53,000 cases do not list the patient’s race or ethnicity.  By way of comparison, whites account for 60% of the state’s population, Latinos make up 17%, and African Americans account for 14%.  About 2,400 Illinoisans have died from COVID-19, 40% of whom were white, 35% were black and 14% were Latino.  Arise Chicago labor organizer Jorge Mujica said another reason behind the rising cases among Latinos is they are at high risk of contracting the virus at their workplaces.  “It’s obvious that the source of the spread of the virus has shifted from people traveling to people working, and we know Latinos and African Americans are more likely to work outside their homes,” he said.  Mujica said Latino workers across the state have complained to him about employers not providing proper equipment and work conditions that don’t allow for social distancing.  “Labor laws are violated everyday, this is nothing new, and so we’re seeing the same thing when it comes to the new coronavirus rules and guidelines,” he said.  State figures show many ZIP codes reporting the highest number of coronavirus cases encompass predominantly Latino working-class areas like Little Village and Belmont Cragin in Chicago and suburbs like Cicero.

"The Grayzone, a US-based independent news outlet, recently published a story busting the conspiracy theory of COVID-19 escaping from China’s Wuhan Institute of Virology, adding that it is ""the Trump administration’s Iraqi WMD.""  Apart from digging into stories behind the conspiracy theories, the Grayzone also released many reports related to Northwest China’s Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in recent months. For example, it released a report in March that stated ""forced labour"" stories hyped by some Western and US media and US-based nongovernmental organisations are orchestrated by the “US government, NATO, arms industry to drive Cold War PR blitz”.  To learn more about The Grayzone and its work, the Global Times reporter Liu Xin(GT) spoke to Max Blumenthal(B), an award-winning journalist and founder of the Grayzone.  GT: Do you think The Grayzone is anti-US, as some people criticized?  B: I'm an American. I live here in Washington, DC. Many of my neighbours, where I live in southeast Washington, DC, agree with my opinions. My neighbours are African-American and have been mostly left out by society. They understand that a country that is spending billions and trillions of dollars on an empire abroad is unable to bring them anything at home. And our readers are mostly American.  We are supported by the American people and people across the West. We are also supported by the American people in the greatest sense because we're supported by people from Latin America who are victims of the American empire, who have family living in the US. So, I think the most American thing to do is to expose an empire that is not giving back to the people.  We can see it so clearly in the time of coronavirus when so many people are being betrayed by this government, including American military personnel, like these sailors on Theodore Roosevelt, who have been simply betrayed. We care about them as well. That's really what our interest is in.  The only way they can hurt us is if they prove that we are printing lies, or if they're willing to debate us and show that our arguments are false. But, they're not able to do that.  GT: Some people claimed The Grayzone has a pro-China attitude, especially on the issues of coronavirus and Xinjiang. Do you agree?  B: The Greyzone does not speak for China any more than we speak for the United States. But we speak for people in the West who are opposed to war, and who are sceptical of the narratives that were being fed.  We're an independent website. We put a lot of effort into understanding the propaganda and stories that we hear. And, when we hear a story again and again and again, that is leading us to become more hostile towards another country, that's when our alarm bells go off, and we start to investigate.  One of our contributors, Ajit Singh, is a specialist in anti-China propaganda. He is also studying Chinese society and Chinese politics. He is in school to become an actual China expert. He helped expose stories behind reports on “millions of Uygurs in concentration camps in Xinjiang” by just simply looking at the sources and going deeper and deeper into the story until he found the original source.  © AP Photo / Ng Han Guan Elderly residents wearing masks against the coronavirus wait outside a bank in Wuhan in central China's Hubei province Thursday, April 16, 2020  One of the sources about [the claim] was a Chinese dissident organisation and a group of Chinese activists who are opposed to the Chinese Communist Party and who are based here in Washington. They're called Chinese human rights defenders, and they are funded by the NED, the US government's regime change arm. They produced a study that claimed that there were 600,000 and a million Uygurs in “concentration camps”.  But the study only interviewed a few Uygurs, and then from those interviews, they calculated the population of the villages from where those Uygurs came from and then extrapolated from the population, the total number. It's a completely phony methodology from a partisan US-backed group.  The other source was Adrian Zenz, who is also part of a right-wing, US government-backed group called Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation.  This group, as an extremist group, exists to erase socialism from the earth, and they are funded by the US government. They have meetings in the US capitol. They have a memorial here in Washington. Zenz himself is a Christian extremist, and he has said that he is on a mission from God against China. But this is the person who is considered the leading expert on Xinjiang in Washington, and who has been quoted in many respected journals on this story.  Ajit Singh, our contributor, looked into Zenz’s source and found that his source was a Uygur separatist publication called Istiqlal TV, which is broadcast out of Turkey and has given voice to many extremists. Basically, they appear to have invented it out of whole cloth.  I want to emphasize; I have not been to Xinjiang. I can't claim for certain what's happening there. I've read many reliable reports that there is an enormous amount of surveillance there. But the point is that we are being fed a story, which is aiming to make the American public believe, China is Nazi Germany, and that will only lead us to war. And, this story appears to be a massive exaggeration. I would like to talk about it to the American public. It's unfortunate that only a Chinese network wants to interview me about it. But that's the kind of situation we're in.  I would definitely like to come as a tourist and be able to see for myself. I would like to visit Wuhan and see everything with an open mind.  But now I'm stuck at home. I have not had a haircut in a month. Everything is closed, and it's very frightening to me that my government is using this situation to try to push us closer to war with a country that very few Americans understand, and very few Americans have visited.  All I can do from where I am right now is to expose the American institutions and figures that are deceiving the American public into war with, whether it's China, Venezuela, or Iran.  GT: As criticizing China has become politically correct in the US, have you come under some pressure for releasing stories on China?  B: Yes, we face heavy criticism, and we face many insults. People say, “you are genocide denier” or “you support other fascist country of China”. People say we support Russia and were paid by Venezuela and Cuba.  We face a lot of pressure for it. We faced fake lawsuits. I've been arrested and jailed because of the fake allegation made against me by the Venezuelan opposition here in Washington. Our writers are constantly insulted on social media. But one thing that people cannot do to us is accuse us of factual inaccuracies or debate us. We've extended the opportunity for some of our critics to debate us, and they usually say no.  The Greyzone was founded in 2015 to shine a light on the excesses of American foreign policy and how it was affecting us at home. Since then, we have taken on some of the hardest topics to discuss in the US, which I believe are leading the US to war.  We're simply there to expose the lie of the day. Whenever the public is being lied to and dragged into greater hostility with other nations, they don't understand; we're there to help them unpack the lies. We don't publish editorials. We publish simply reporting and analysis.  And we are an independent website. We are completely independently supported. We are not supported by any states or billionaires. We are supported by our readers.  This article has been published in partnership with the Global Times.

"New Delhi (Sputnik): At a time when global shipping, including that of China’s trade, has fallen to a record low due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Beijing has started deploying warships to the Indian Ocean. The Indian Navy has announced its operational preparedness, but there are severe costs for the anti-China maritime posture in the region.  The Chinese Ministry of National Defence (MND) announced the deployment of the 690 naval personnel-strong 35th Task Force of the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) to the Gulf of Aden on Wednesday in order to carry out anti-piracy patrols in the Indian Ocean, which is considered India’s geopolitical sphere of influence.  The PLAN's guided missile destroyer the Taiyan and the frigate Jingzhou will for the first time ever protect ""ships and vessels” passing through the region.  The task force, comprising at least two dozen naval helicopters and replenishment oiler the Chaohu, will also support vessels off the coast of Somalia, where the PLAN has been carrying out naval escort missions since December 2008.  The announcement comes at a time when the International Maritime Bureau’s latest global piracy report shows zero hijackings in the last two quarters and no incidents around Somalia. Global shipping data also suggest a massive decline in the number of ships calling on ports, including in Europe and China.  Explaining the purpose of such a deployment at this time, Captain D.K. Sharma, who retired from the Indian Navy in September 2019 after serving as the spokesperson for 10 years, tells Sputnik: “The foothold which the PLA Navy established in 2008 in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), in the garb of anti-piracy missions, won't be diluted at any cost”.  The captain brings up Beijing’s strategy – termed the ""String of Pearls"" by the US consultancy Booz Allen Hamilton in its 2005 report “Energy Futures in Asia” – to expand its naval presence throughout the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) by building maritime civilian infrastructure in friendly countries.  © AFP 2020 / HO / Iranian Army office A photo shows a view of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy Surface Force Type 052D destroyer Xining (117), the Islamic Republic of Iran Navy frigate ""ALBORZ"" (72), and the Russian Navy Neustrashimyy-class frigate ""Yaroslav Mudry"" (777) during joint Iran-Russia-China naval drills in the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Oman  “It (String of Pearls) was a well thought-out strategy. Also, they (Beijing) have interests in the Indian Ocean Region with Djibouti, Gwadar, Myanmar Bangladesh etc., as part of their One Belt One Road programme. Anti-piracy patrol is an alibi to cover up their other designs in the overall scheme of things”, the captain says.  Ever since the 2005 report, many strategic analysts have also termed it as a strategy to encircle India, which has a dominant position in the Indian Ocean Region. However, China has denied any such strategy.  “Happy Hunting” Has Its Cost  The Indian Navy has clearly indicated that it will not lose its stance in the Indian Ocean Region, despite the battle against COVID-19.  Stating the impact of China in the Indian Ocean Region, former Indian Navy spokesperson Sharma says: “Presence of Chinese PLA Navy ships in Indian Ocean Region [does] make a difference to [the] Indian Navy as they have to keep a constant eye on their movements. These ships are involved in many other activities apart from normal patrols in Gulf of Aden”.  For the second time in a month, when it is assisting civilian authorities in the fight against COVID-19, the Indian Navy released a statement on 18 April stating: “Our assets continue to remain on patrol covering a vast oceanic swath from the Straits of Malacca in the East to Bab-el-Mandeb in the West, including undertaking Operation Sankalp to provide reassurance and protection to our merchant vessels and anti-piracy patrols in Gulf of Aden”.  Sharma also states that this will only add a financial burden on the Indian Navy, which has also increased its strategic co-operation of-late to counter China.  Apart from incurring huge costs on operating around 50 combat-ready warships — destroyers, frigates, corvettes, large patrol vessels — and daily sorties by Poseidon P-8I maritime patrol aircraft, which are now permanently positioned in the Indian Ocean Region, the “mission-based deployment” also wears out the Indian Navy’s combat assets and trained personnel.  #MissionBasedDeployments From Persian Gulf to Malacca Straits & from Northern Bay of Bengal to Southern Indian Ocean to East coast of Africa @indiannavy with 50 ships on vigil 24X7 keep our Area of Responsibility (AOR) safe. @indiannavy Anytime, Anywhere Everytime @nsitharaman pic.twitter.com/rxmBAed5Sa — SpokespersonNavy (@indiannavy) April 17, 2018  Indian Navy commanders have raised concerns over critical capability gaps in ship-borne helicopters, fleet support ships, and submarines. This means that continuous deployment of these assets raises the possibility of accidents and encounters at sea.  These concerns compound the already existing financial crisis caused by COVID-19, as a top official of India's Defence Ministry told Sputnik that the defence budget is being reduced by 20-30 percent this year.  For 2020, the Navy received around $3 billion for revenue expenditures and around $3.8 billion for capital expenditures, which is $3 billion lower than the projected expenditure this year. The Navy had already pulled back its requirement of Mine Counter Measure Vessels, helicopters, and P-8I reconnaissance aircraft.  Naval Deployments for All  The two Asian giants have emphasised time and again that their naval deployments are not only for their own purposes, but they can provide assistance to their friendly neighbours as well.  As China despatched its naval combat force — the first time in four years — consisting of around a dozen warships, India called off any strong action against the then Abdulla Yameen government, which was considered pro-China.  Past incidents suggest that such deployments come in handy in times of crisis to governments having close relations with Beijing. This was evident in 2018, when the Abdulla Yameen government announced a state of emergency in the Maldives and India had to rush its aircraft and ships to its southern bases.  However, India has been moving forward to establish a new base on Assumptions Island in the Seychelles and negotiated military access to naval facilities at ports in Oman and Indonesia last year.  COVID-19 Challenges to Navy  Indian Navy Chief Karambir Singh told commanders in a video message on 7 March that “it can no longer be business as usual”.  Hence, the Chinese deployment in a time of crisis poses a big challenge for the Indian Navy, whose warships are teeming with men more than other navies — as evident during the multilateral exercise — to operate in full capability while maintaining physical distancing to remain COVID-19-free.

"Madonna revealed that she has tested positive for coronavirus antibodies.  “Took a test the other day. And I found out that I have the antibodies,” the singer, 61, said in her latest Madame X-themed “Quarantine Diary” on Instagram Thursday.  “So tomorrow,” Madonna added, “I’m just going to go for a long drive in a car, and I’m going to roll down the window, and I’m going to breathe in, I’m going to breathe in the COVID-19 air. Yup. I hope the sun is shining.”  Antibody tests check antibodies in your blood to see if you were previously exposed to the virus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The federal agency says “a positive test result shows you have antibodies that likely resulted from an infection with SARS-CoV-2,” the virus that causes COVID-19.  Although Madonna may be ready to hit the road following her positive antibody test results, the CDC says it’s unclear if the antibodies will make you immune to the virus or prevent you from getting infected again.  Madonna captioned her quarantine diary with the hashtags #staysafe #staysane  “Here’s the good news,” she added on Instagram. “Tomorrow’s another day and I’m going to wake up and I’m going to feel differently.”  Last month, Madonna stirred controversy after calling the coronavirus ”the great equalizer.”  “That’s the thing about COVID-19,” she said “It doesn’t care about how rich you are, how famous you are, how funny you are, how smart you are, where you live, how old you are, what amazing stories you can tell. It’s the great equalizer.”  According to the singer, “what’s terrible” about the virus is also “what’s great about it.”  Like many artists in the entertainment industry, Madonna canceled the remainder of her tour, “Madame X,” over safety concerns last month.

"States were in good financial shape before the coronavirus pandemic.  But they now face massive budget deficits.  Without immediate federal aid, states will start be forced to slash their budgets, laying off workers en masse, cutting funds for education and healthcare, and more.  Michael Leachman is Senior Director of State Fiscal Research at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.  This is an opinion column. The thoughts expressed are those of the author.  Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.  A week ago, President Trump, Democratic leaders in Congress, and the National Governors Association's bipartisan leaders all expressed support for Washington providing fiscal relief for cash-strapped states in the next stimulus measure.  They recognized that, due to what's becoming the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, states are facing budget shortfalls of unprecedented size and — without relief — they'll start laying off first responders, teachers, and health care workers and cutting spending in other ways that will deepen the recession.  Now, however, Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and other Senate Republicans are suggesting that the state budget crisis reflects the fiscal irresponsibility of Democrat-run states and arguing that Washington shouldn't bail them out because that would only reward their profligacy.  But, as John Adams said, facts are stubborn things. And the fact is that states face a budget crisis not because they've mismanaged their finances. It's because all over America, in states led by Republicans as well as Democrats, businesses have closed and millions have lost their jobs, and, as a result, state tax revenues have dried up at a record pace. States get 70% of their tax revenues from sales and income taxes, and both are collapsing because places where people shop are closed and the millions who are now laid off aren't paying income taxes.  To prevent states from making deep budget cuts and imposing massive layoffs that would make the economic crisis even worse, the federal government must provide significant fiscal relief as soon as possible and ensure that it remains in place until the economy recovers.  States are facing a massive budget crisis  Unlike the federal government, almost all states must balance their budgets each year. As their current fiscal years draw to a close on June 30, their shrinking revenues are creating huge shortfalls that they must fill this spring as well as projections of more enormous shortfalls for the coming years.  At the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, we project states will have a combined $650 billion in shortfalls from fiscal years 2020 through 2022. Many local governments will face shortfalls on top of that.  Without significant relief from the federal government, states will have to take drastic action to balance their budgets, such as slashing education and healthcare, laying off teachers and other workers, and canceling contracts with businesses. That would take money out of the economy at just the wrong time, making the recession deeper, delaying the recovery, and hurting millions of families.  States were in good shape before the pandemic  Far from mismanaging their finances of late, states did a reasonable job in recent years of preparing for a recession, with ""rainy day"" funds of about 7.5% of state budgets, which was higher than before the last recession. Their total reserves, which include the year-end balances in their general funds, were also higher.  Also in better shape were the state trust funds that support unemployment insurance programs. The problem is that nobody could have predicted that a global pandemic would send the economy into such a steep nosedive and eviscerate state finances so quickly.  States have hardly been overspending of late. State general fund spending for current operations — basic functions like schools, healthcare, the justice system, and public health — is significantly lower as a share of the economy than before the last recession. Frankly, states have spent too little in some key areas, shortchanging investments needed for future economic growth.  For instance, states have fewer teachers and other school workers than a decade ago, even though they now have many more students. State funding for higher education per pupil is down an average of 13% from about a decade ago in inflation-adjusted terms, forcing colleges to raise tuition and putting college out of reach for more families. And, as a share of the economy, states are spending far less on infrastructure than decades ago, shortchanging another key tool for economic growth.  Funding for critical services  McConnell's suggestion that states would use fiscal relief to bail out their pension systems is badly off-base. For starters, they would put fiscal relief dollars into their general funds, not the separate trust funds that cover pensions.  While states and localities make payments into the pension funds to help cover future obligations, these payments comprise an overage of just 4.7% of state and local general fund spending.  Rather than help the states, McConnell has said that Washington should let them go bankrupt. That would do nothing to help the economy now, however, and it would hurt the states in the coming years.  Bankruptcy lets individuals and businesses ease their debt and cancel their obligations, but state debt isn't high by historical standards and states should be able to meet those obligations when the economy recovers. Since the late 1800s, only one state (Arkansas in 1934) has ever defaulted on its general obligation debt.  Letting states declare bankruptcy could significantly raise their borrowing costs for major transportation and other projects because investors, who would worry about getting repaid, would demand higher interest payments.  Rather than turn an unprecedented state budget crisis into just one more partisan brawl in Washington, the White House and Senate Republican leaders should support the desperately needed fiscal relief that will protect the jobs of many thousands of workers, ease the deep economic downturn, and soften its blow for millions of families.

"Late April and early May is a time when the Wolves and other teams plan for the future. That’s still the case this year, even though the season is technically alive and it’s unclear how the AHL will proceed if it resumes or when the next one will begin.  Jon Sata, the Wolves’ senior vice president of partnerships and business development said the franchise would be ready if this season restarted, but “most everything is pointed toward a start next season.” There are already some provisional dates for the next campaign, and as of Wednesday, the league’s plan was that 2020-21 would be business as usual in the fall until it’s not.  “Our first wave of planning has an early October start for games and that we’ll play a traditional season,” Sata said. “The Plan B looks like a delayed start to the season and the potential of a truncated season thereafter. I think the way that we’re approaching it is planning for the full schedule, and then if we have to pare it down, we’ll adjust -accordingly.”  Sata said the Wolves would work with Allstate Arena on scheduling because, like other venues, arena management will try to rebook the events lost during the spring, summer and potentially the fall. That means the building could have a very busy slate even before the Wolves’ home schedule is plotted.  “It’s a big puzzle that we’re doing our best to stay on top of,” Sata said. “We’ll have it put together when we’re ready to go.”  When that happens is anybody’s guess.  On April 24, AHL president and CEO David Andrews said on SiriusXM that the league is beginning to pivot toward the 2020-21 season. Playing games without fans, Andrews said, would be very unlikely because the AHL is a gate-driven league.  Andrews said the AHL is building for an October start next season and needs to be ready for that possibility. But it also must look for operating models beginning in November, December and January.  Presumably, one part of the equation for teams is adjusting for an economy that will look much different than it did March 8, when the Wolves last hosted a game. Sata, however, sounded confident that wouldn’t affect the Wolves as much because of their ticket prices.  “If the economy is challenged when this starts again, which it likely will be, I think we’re in a favorable spot,” Sata said.  Sata said a larger worry is people’s comfort in a public setting. The Wolves will follow all public guidelines. The Village of Rosemont, which owns and operates Allstate Arena, will be committed to following those rules and making sure that the building is safe, with precautions such as touch-free sinks, soap dispensers and overly aggressive sterilization and cleaning measures.  But in general, Sata is trying to keep things in perspective and find some positives. The stoppage and the complications it has caused are a hassle for the sports world, but compared to what other people are dealing with, these are “first-world problems” for the Wolves.  The time has allowed the Wolves to catch their breath, evaluate the business and maybe come out a better organization.  “This is tough, this is challenging, but some of the best outcomes come from adverse situations,” Sata said. “We need to push through that and maintain positivity and find some positivity in this.”",1
"NEW YORK — CBS News “60 Minutes” correspondent Lesley Stahl said Sunday that she’s finally feeling well after a battle with COVID-19 that left her hospitalized for a week.  Stahl said she was “really scared” after fighting pneumonia caused by the coronavirus for two weeks at home before going to the hospital.  “One of the rules of journalism is ‘don’t become part of the story,’” Stahl said at the end of Sunday’s broadcast. “But instead of covering the pandemic, I was one of the more-than-one-million Americans who did become part of it.”  Stahl, 78, is the dean of correspondents at television’s best-known newsmagazine. She joined “60 Minutes” in March 1991, and before that was moderator of the Sunday talk show “Face the Nation” and a Washington correspondent.  She landed the first television interview with Donald Trump after he was elected president, and the first with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi when she become speaker — both in 2007 and again in 2019.  Stahl said there was a cluster of “60 Minutes” employees with the virus. One “had almost no symptoms while others had almost every symptom you can imagine,” she said. “Each case is different.”  Stahl said she found an overworked and nearly overwhelmed staff when she was hospitalized but paid tribute to their care, and said she was wheeled out through a gauntlet of cheering medical workers when discharged.  “In the face of so much death, they celebrate their triumphs,” she said.  60 Minutes declined to name the hospital involved.  “Thanks to them, like so many other patients, I am well now,” she said. “Tonight, we all owe them our gratitude, our admiration and, in some cases, our lives.”  Stahl is arguably the most prominent television journalist to disclose they had the disease. CNN hosts Chris Cuomo and Brooke Baldwin have tested positive, the former continuing his prime-time show while fighting symptoms. ABC “Good Morning America” host George Stephanopoulos had it, but like many infected, had only mild symptoms.  The virus has infected 3.5 million people and killed more than 246,000 worldwide, including more than 66,000 dead in the United States, according to a count by Johns Hopkins University. Experts say the numbers are likely larger.",1
"A group of Chicago researchers hope an electronic monitor that affixes to the throat like a band-aid will aid in the detection of coronavirus cases among health-care workers who might not recognize subtle symptoms.  The device will also be used to track the recovery of patients from their homes and hospital beds.  “It’s like a wireless stethoscope glued to your neck,” John A. Rogers, a Northwestern University professor of biomedical engineering who partners with the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab.  The device monitors breathing, coughing, temperature and heart rate — data that is uploaded and made available to doctors every night when the wearer puts it on a charging dock.  Though originally designed to help monitor the recovery of stroke patients, researchers realized it could be used to measure the vibratory signatures of coronavirus symptoms.  The devices are being worn by about 10 doctors and nurses working in Chicago. They’re also on about 20 patients who are recovering at home and in hospital beds. Rogers expects that number to soon grow.  Rogers and his team can produce about 100 of the devices a week. If demand outpaces their ability to make the devices, Rogers said he’d find a manufacturer who could handle higher quantities.",1

A scary government projection calls for a skyrocketing of new cases by the end of the month. The coronavirus wallops some young people too. Dictators should be tough on the pandemic, but they're botching it. An overlooked detail in a Supreme Court ruling should worry Republicans. The ""murder hornet""?! Biden shouldn't release his Senate archives unless Trump releases his tax returns. Mr. Buffett waves the white flag on airlines. The Big 3...  3 possible futures for the pandemic  As the US starts to reopen, researchers have published estimates for the shape of the pandemic. They forecast that the pandemic will last 18 to 24 months, and they describe three scenarios:  1. ""Peaks and valleys."" In this scenario, the current wave — the second and highest wave on the chart below —will recede over the summer and then be followed by additional waves of similar magnitude for one to two years. The severity will vary by region and country. Different cities and countries may reimplement restrictions and mitigation measures.  Moore, Lipsitch, Barry, Osterholm  2. ""Fall peak."" The current wave would recede over the summer, as in the first scenario. But then we would be hit with a far more severe wave this fall. This is what happened in the 1918-19 ""Great Influenza"" pandemic, as well as less devastating flu pandemics in 1957-58 and 2009-10.  Moore, Lipsitch, Barry, Osterholm  3. ""Slow burn."" The most encouraging scenario. The current wave is by far the worst. And then the pandemic smolders for an additional few years while life goes on.  Moore, Lipsitch, Barry, Osterholm  Note that none of these scenarios involves the coronavirus just disappearing after this first big wave recedes.  The researchers do not address the possibility that scientists will develop a powerful drug in the next few months that can ""cure"" the disease or a vaccine that will prevent it. They note that vaccines have not played a role in prior flu pandemics.  Sharon Begley of STAT News describes each of these scenarios in detail here. —HB  Meanwhile, a government document projects that the US ""daily case"" and ""daily death"" rates will skyrocket later this month  The New York Times got its hands on a document described as a ""situation update"" from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.  The document appears to have been updated through May 1. It includes projections for a radical increase in expected ""new cases per day"" and ""deaths per day"" in the second half of this month.  US Department of Homeland Security presentation, via New York Times  Department of Homeland Security, via New York Times  To emphasize: The top chart calls for the skyrocketing of daily new cases to more than 200,000 by the end of May, up from about 30,000 now.  The presentation does not explain why the model predicts this acceleration.  An hour after the document was published, the White House disavowed it. A White House representative told Insider's Eliza Relman that it ""is not a White House document nor has it been presented to the Coronavirus Task Force or gone through interagency vetting"" and that ""this data is not reflective of any of the modeling done by the task force or data that the task force has analyzed.""  So now we need to understand where those projections came from and whether any government experts believe they are realistic.  Here are the historical numbers in the presentation, which have plateaued at about 30,000 new cases and 2,000 deaths per day:  Department of Homeland Security, via New York Times  Yes, the coronavirus is roughest on old and sick people, but it's awful for some younger people too  Insider's Aria Bendix, a healthy reporter in her 20s, developed nasty COVID-19 symptoms in late March, which she described here. Nearly 50 days later, she's still not back to full strength.  Aria's not alone. Here, she interviews four other otherwise healthy people in their 20s and 30s who have been sick for more than a month.  Meanwhile, Insider's Lydia Ramsey describes how doctors in New York City continue to be surprised and alarmed by the number of younger people who are getting COVID-19, as well as how serious it is for some of them.  In New York, 18- to 44-year-olds make up about 10% of total cases. More than 4,300 of them have been hospitalized. Nearly 300 of them have died. —HB  Will summer help?  There is still hope that warmer temperatures will halt or at least slow the spread of the virus.  The researchers in the study and the article referenced above conclude that summer will reduce the transmissibility of the virus by about 20% — enough to slow it down, but not enough to eliminate it. —HB  Dictators should be great during a pandemic. Why are they botching it?  Russian President Vladimir Putin listens to Denis Protsenko, chief physician of a hospital for COVID-19 patients on the outskirts of Moscow on March 24. Sputnik/Alexey Druzhinin/Kremlin/Reuters  Russia's COVID-19 outbreak is blazing, with record cases reported on Sunday. Wouldn't you think Vladimir Putin would be handling it better?  Authoritarians love nothing more than ordering the government to do whatever they want, imposing tight controls on the population, and wantonly enacting emergency restrictions, so you'd expect Putin and his fellow authoritarians to shine during the pandemic. But it's not working out that way.  Across the world, dictators, as well as democratically elected leaders with authoritarian tendencies, are doing poorly. Putin seems bored by the crisis. Iran continues to be a wreck. The dictator of Belarus, denying that the coronavirus is a threat, has ordered life to continue as usual, leading to one of the world's fastest-rising infection rates. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's he-man approach— combining skepticism of science with macho recklessness — has made a mess of Brazil's response.  This isn't a hard-and-fast rule. Plenty of vibrant democracies — Spain, Italy — have struggled with outbreaks, and China almost certainly extinguished its outbreak more rapidly thanks to its totalitarian tools. But in general, controlling the virus seems easier when there's public trust in government, reliable and transparent data, and visible popular support for action — all of which are hard for authoritarians to muster. Also authoritarians tend to prefer problems they can solve quickly with force or rhetoric, neither of which works on the coronavirus.  Oh, and it doesn't help to build trust in public health when any health professional who casts doubt on the government's response falls out a window the next day, as seems to happen in Russia. —DP  Vote-by-mail data that could worry Republicans  Voters wearing masks line up at Riverside High School in Milwaukee for Wisconsin's primary election on April 7. Morry Gash/AP Images  The savage battle over voting by mail in the 2020 election could be shaped by some unexpected news out of Wisconsin. Last month, as Wisconsin held in-person voting during the pandemic, the US Supreme Court refused to extend the deadline for mail-in ballots. The ruling was seen as a big win for Republicans.  Less noticed was that the court did allow Wisconsin to accept ballots postmarked by Election Day. Under previous rules, Wisconsin accepted only ballots that arrived by Election Day. The Washington Post found that in Wisconsin's two biggest cities, 10% of all ballots were postmarked before Election Day and arrived after Election Day. In other words, 10% of voters in those cities wouldn't have even been counted in previous years.  The Wisconsin vote could be anomalous: Wisconsin officials and voters had only a few days to prepare and no precedent for pandemic voting. The rest of the country will have months to set rules for pandemic-afflicted balloting.  Still the Wisconsin mail-in data may alarm Republicans, who generally benefit from fewer people voting. Expect them to seek to limit the SCOTUS ruling and to persuade state legislatures to find other ways to restrict voting by mail. Seven states, all Republican-controlled, have already limited balloting by mail to elderly voters. —DP  What will restaurants and offices look like post-pandemic?

(Meanwhile, in a sign of how hard the virus is to control, the city of Harbin has just closed ""dine-in"" restaurants after an outbreak.)  And The New York Times speculates how the pandemic will transform open-plan offices into places with sneeze guards, push-down air vents, and way more space between coworkers.

One or two of these boxes, the theory goes, might contain references to Tara Reade, the former staffer who recently accused Biden of sexually assaulting her.  Biden denied the allegations in an interview on Friday and said that the Delaware boxes didn't contain any materials related to Reade.  Reade has said that the boxes aren't likely to contain any references to a sexual assault because she didn't tell Biden's team about it.  Naturally, people are still calling on Biden to unseal all those boxes. If he doesn't, the existence of the boxes threatens to become the same sort of ""what's he hiding?"" weapon that was used so effectively against Hillary Clinton in 2016. (""But her emails…"")  The desire to search all potential evidence to get to the bottom of the story is understandable. But the request that Biden unseal his boxes when President Donald Trump still has yet to release his tax returns seems an absurd double standard. —HB  Warren Buffett gives up on airlines  The Oracle of Omaha announced that he had dumped all his airline holdings. He thinks it's unlikely that as many people will fly in the next two to three years as they did last year. And he believes that even if capacity returns to 70% to 80% of what it once was, the airlines will still have too many planes.  History supports this view.  The last big gut punch to the industry came after 9/11. The fallout from that event was shorter and less devastating than the current one. But still … the economist David Rosenberg of Rosenberg Research points that it took about seven years for travel spending on airlines to recover. —HB  The Big 3*!

"According to South Korean scientists a number of reported cases of COVID-19 patients relapsing after overcoming the disease were due to faulty testing; researchers at the South Korean CDC now say that it is impossible for COVID-19 to reactivate in human bodies.  In South Korea there have been over 10,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 245 deaths, that is a 2.3% fatality rate which is lower than the 3.4% averaged as stated by W.H.O. In South Korea a total of 277 patients were reported to have fallen ill for a second time, as with China and Japan.  The apparent reinfections prompted concerns over the virus mutating at a rate so quickly that people would not be able to build immunity against it. The following genetic analyses of the virus did not yield any substantial changes in the virus that would effectively disguise it from the immune system.  As a result of these reports W.H.O has warned against using “immunity passports” as a way of allowing people to return to work simply because they have antibodies for the virus in approaches for countries to begin to lift restrictions and lock downs in a targeted manner to resume economic activity. Such passports would be issued to those who have overcome COVI-19 infections and tested positive for antibodies for the virus based on the assumption of them being immune, but they rely on the accuracy of the testing.  In an update to this guidance WHO warned that there was ""no evidence that people who have recovered from COVID-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection"". It was also not expected that the PCR testing used to check for blood antigens for the actual particles of the virus itself would have issues.  The South Korean CDC has found that the PCR test results for the suspected relapsed patients were false positives, warning that the tests were not able to distinguish between live traces of the virus and the harmless dead samples that remain after the patient has recovered.  W.H.O is warning that immunity certification will depend upon the accuracy and reliability of the testing that is being rapidly developed, which under normal circumstances take years of trials to determine.  ""People who assume that they are immune to a second infection because they have received a positive test result may ignore public health advice,"" the WHO warned. ""The use of such certificates may therefore increase the risks of continued transmission,"" its guidance added at the time, although this guidance is currently being kept under review.  Unlike other viruses like HIV and chickenpox that can break into the nucleus of human cells to stay latent for years before reactivating, COVID-19 stays outside of the host’s cell nucleus according to the South Korean CDC.  ""This means it does not cause chronic infection or recurrence,"" explained Dr Oh Myoung-dong, the head of the CDC committee, meaning it is unlikely for patients to relapse in this fashion.  However, if the virus mutates further it could be possible that COVID-19 could infect people who had previously overcome it in the future, in a manner similar to that of the flu.",0
"New Zealand has chosen strict lock downs and austerity but what is next, and what have they done to have virtually eliminated this coronavirus outbreak on their island nation, according to the nation’s leader.  ""There is no widespread undetected community transmission in New Zealand. We have won that battle,"" Prime Minister Ardern said. ""But we must remain vigilant if we are to keep it that way.""  The normally very busy and active island is now basically barren in comparison since the outbreak, deserted highways are just one manifestation of their resolute response to COVID-19; under their stringent lock down orders lights are dark and patios empty at every pub, cafe, and business, while there is yellow police tape sealing off parks and playgrounds with swings and equipment being tied up and out of reach to ward off temptation, as well as trails have barriers with closed signs at their entrances.  The emptiness across this beautiful island shows that the residents here are following orders and there is not much risk of transgression other than an occasional jogger or a person out for a brief stroll to get some air. Everything is closed except a few paved paths to and from towns to get essential supplies.  Close to 4 million visitors travel to New Zealand to experience its picturesque splendor and wilderness landscape, that is approximately 80% of the resident population, but this outbreak has forced the country to close all of the sought after landscapes and its borders.  If there is a shiny spot amid the global responses to this outbreak, New Zealand just might be it. While other governments have been more than a little indecisive wavering between different opinions and actions on the best response allowing the ensuing cases of infection to soar, New Zealand has set an uncompromising science driven example.  The country banned travel from China on February 3rd and since then their trajectory of new cases looked out of control until mid March when their austerity measures seemingly have been able to bring the spread of COVID-19 to heel on the island nation.  On March 15 the country began mandatory quarantines on all visitors, the strictest policy at the time, and just 10 days later New Zealand instituted a complete countrywide lock down which included a moratorium on the domestic level. The level 4 restrictions meant that hospitals, pharmacies, petrol stations and grocery stores were the only commerce allowed to be open, vehicle travel was restricted, and social interaction was limited to within households.  The Prime Minister of New Zealand made clear, concise statements about the situation to the nation, and was bolstered by a team of scientists and health professionals to help stop any confusion or panic about the sudden austerity, while delivering and supporting the same message. She also announced a few days after the lock down that the country rather than just slowing the transmission of the virus had set a course to eradicate the virus by cutting off the arrival of new cases and choking out any existing ones with these restrictions.  “We must fight by going hard and going early,” Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said in a statement to the nation on March 14. “We have the opportunity to do something no other country has achieved: elimination of the virus. But it will continue to need a team of 5 million behind it.”  “The virus doesn’t have superpowers. Once transmission is stopped, it’s gone,” said Petousis-Harris, a vaccine expert at the University of Auckland, who suggests that the country had managed to avoid the confusion and half-measures that have hampered the response in many other countries. “New Zealand got everything right,” she said. “Decisive action, with strong leadership and very clear communications to everybody.”  Looking at New Zealand from the outside perspective it is rather different than the indecisiveness, confusion, and whinging being seen in America, in New Zealand the entire country simply got on board with the idea as it was clearly and concisely explained to them. In this country right from day one of their lock down the streets and highways were empty, stores were closed and everyone stayed home rather than complaining like entitled children having a temper tantrum.  Since their measures were put into place, they appear to be working as their daily infection rate in this island nation of 4.9 million people has been decreasing steadily from the maximum of 146 in March to just a few cases by mid April; in all New Zealand has reported a high of 1,476 cases with 19 deaths, and on April 26th, the country experienced no new COVID-19 cases and no community transmission for the first time in 6 weeks, but 7 new cases appeared on April 30, 2020.  Even with the 7 new cases the low numbers gave the government the confidence to ease up on the country’s social distancing restrictions to lower them to Level 3 at the end of April, and Ardern pronounced that the virus had been eliminated, she later clarified that “elimination doesn’t mean zero cases... we will have to keep stamping COVID out....” Downgrading to level 3 means that most but not all businesses are being allowed to reopen provided they follow safety measures, but all that require face to face contact must remain closed until level 2 is reached.  ""Your business must be contactless. Your customers can pay online, over the phone or in a contactless way,"" she said. ""Delivery or pickup must also be contactless.""  Even though New Zealand is sounding fairly confident about eliminating this virus, the success is not guaranteed. For instance other countries such as Singapore that also appeared to have the virus under control have now been struggling with a second wave of infections, and in China which also appeared to stop the spread completely are now contending with a second wave as well.  If New Zealand has managed to contain this virus outbreak, the country will still face a long and hard road, as once they are virus free they will need to maintain the total halt on all arrivals from outside of the country or risk the chance of reinfection until the entire world has managed to snuff out the virus as well. For a country like New Zealand that is largely reliant on tourism in terms of foreign exchange earnings that accounts for 10% of the GDP and nearly 15% of their workforce that is a tough prospect. For the Kiwi economy this puts hundreds of thousands of jobs at stake, and it is forecasted that the country will be among the hardest hit nations, which may not recover until at least 2024.  Australia has also been experiencing a decline in their new cases since their peak a month ago, according to their home affairs minister Peter Dutton, New Zealand and Australia are at a comparable stage in their fight against COVID-19.  Recent surveys indicate that 87% of the New Zealand population support the way that their government is handling this crisis, and it may have been easier for citizens to fall in to tow the line in this country because in general the vast majority trusts their leaders. In New Zealand it is reported that the streets remain clean and quiet, public services are functioning, stores are well stocked, and the risk of contracting COVID-19 appears to be remote and diminishing with each passing day thanks to clear and concise leadership and the citizens cooperating by following guidelines to do their part in battling the outbreak.",0
"Half of all COVID-19 cases and nearly 60 percent of deaths due to the disease in the US occurred in counties that are disproportionately black, according to newly released data that is still being reviewed by scientists. The numbers of COVID-19 diagnoses and deaths are also higher in counties with a bigger proportion of black residents, the new analysis shows.  Only 22 percent of counties in the United States are disproportionately black, but the people within them have endured the majority of deaths in the country. These findings are the most comprehensive evidence we have yet showing how the novel coronavirus is taking a heavier toll on African Americans since national demographic data on race has so far been incomplete. An accurate picture of who is hardest hit is needed so that these disparities don’t play out again when it comes to who can get a vaccine and treatments as these become available, researchers say.  “We might see history repeat itself”  “Unfortunately, we might see history repeat itself when a vaccine becomes available,” Gregorio Millett, the study’s lead investigator, said in a press call. “That’s why it’s important to have studies like this and other studies that come out to show where COVID-19 diagnoses and deaths are concentrated to make sure that these marginalized populations are among the first to have access.”  This study was released today on the website of amfAR, the Foundation for AIDS Research to allow other scientists to comment on it. The results may change before it is finalized and published. The foundation worked in collaboration with Emory University, Johns Hopkins, O’Neill Institute, Georgetown University, and the University of Mississippi Medical Center. They analyzed data on the pandemic collected on or before April 13th.  The racial breakdown of COVID-19 cases has trickled out from states and cities since March. More than 80 percent of coronavirus patients hospitalized in Georgia were black, according to a recent sample taken by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of 305 patients. That’s despite black residents making up less than one-third of the population. But the CDC’s national data is still missing the races of more than 55 percent of COVID-19 cases nationwide.  Lawmakers have urged the Department of Health and Human Services to collect racial and ethnic demographics. “Lack of information will exacerbate existing health disparities and result in the loss of lives in vulnerable communities,” they wrote in a March 27th letter to the agency. “Existing racial disparities and inequities in health outcomes and health care access may mean that the nation’s response to preventing and mitigating its harms will not be felt equally in every community.”  “the nation’s response to preventing and mitigating its harms will not be felt equally”  More than 90 percent of the disproportionately black counties studied are in the South. But the researchers found that cases and deaths were higher in African American communities, regardless of whether the area was more rural or more urban.  In New York City, the epicenter of the pandemic, there are stark differences in the rates of hospitalizations and deaths by county, according to a recent study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The Bronx has the highest proportion of racial and ethnic minorities and higher death and hospitalization rates than New York City’s other boroughs, which each have their own counties. Manhattan is predominately white, and it has the lowest rates for deaths and hospitalizations.  The new national study also highlighted that rates of being uninsured, living in crowded households, and being exposed to more air pollution were also higher in counties that were disproportionately black — all factors associated with making it harder for these communities to stay healthy. These counties were also less likely to social distance compared to other counties, based on location data from cellphones. The study also noted that African Americans are more likely to be essential workers who aren’t able to work from home, despite shelter-in-place orders.  While the data is still emerging, it’s not necessarily surprising to public health experts who have worked to end racial disparities in a broad range of health outcomes that are a result of long-standing economic and social barriers. “It’s the social conditions that we have created,” says, David Williams, a professor of public health at Harvard, told The Verge in April. “I hope this is a wake up call for America.”",1

Hover to explore county details Note: Counties with fewer than 100 devices in the dataset are shown in gray. Source: Washington Post analysis of SafeGraph data. See full methodology at bottom of article.  According to a Washington Post analysis of data provided by SafeGraph, a company that aggregates cellphone location information, the peak period of our collective, coronavirus-induced lockdown was the seven-day period ending April 7. (There was also a one-day spike on Easter Sunday.) During that time, U.S. residents spent a whopping 93 percent of their time at home, up from the early March averages of roughly 70 percent.  Some governors began relaxing restrictions meant to curb the spread of covid-19 at the end of April, after they were prodded by President Trump and cautioned by public health officials. But as of April 30, people were still at home an average of 89 percent of the time.  The numbers vary greatly by geography. People in some counties appear to barely leave their homes, especially in large metro areas, including hard-hit New York, Detroit and Chicago. People in areas that are less populated tend to leave a bit more, and residents in at least one very rural county in Arizona are approaching the amount of free-roaming time they enjoyed in early March.  Beaches and parks, such as this one in Jacksonville Beach, reopened April 17 â with restrictions â in Duval County, Fla. (Charlotte Kesl for The Washington Post)  To determine when people are home, SafeGraph obtains GPS data through regular pings from smartphones that are running one or more apps from an undisclosed list. (This type of tracking, which requires users to allow location data when they use certain apps, has rattled privacy experts. App users are often not aware that their data is being used by third-party companies.)  [Itâs the middle of the night. Do you know who your iPhone is talking to?]  The company defines âhomeâ as a common location from which a phone pings between 6 p.m. and 7 a.m. When the phone pings from elsewhere, SafeGraph assumes the phone is away from home.  Itâs not a perfect measure, but the data, aggregated from an average of 18 million phones per day, reveals broad insights.  Hereâs where people are going  Just because people are leaving their homes more doesnât mean theyâre flouting stay-at-home orders or that theyâve abandoned social distancing. They simply may be enjoying warmer weather outdoors, especially in places such as the Upper Midwest, which had an unseasonable April cold snap.  [Americans widely oppose reopening most businesses, Post-U. Md. poll finds]  Pings from phones within businesses and recreational areas show where people are â and arenât â showing up. Theyâre going to parks and grocery stores, according to Google data, which tracks users via their Google Accounts and compares their locations to a baseline from before stay-at-home orders were in place.  Park visits have trended upward recently.  Workplace visits, however, have not. The percentage of phones (and presumably, their owners) in workplaces dropped steeply in mid-March and has barely risen. More than 30 million people have filed for unemployment benefits in the past six weeks.  SafeGraphâs more granular data shows people are again hitting general merchandise stores such as Walmart and Target at near-March levels. Some are satisfying fast-food cravings at restaurants with counter service.  The data lines up with responses in a Washington Post-University of Maryland poll released May 5 in which more than half of people said they were comfortable visiting grocery stores, but 78 percent said they would not be comfortable eating at a sit-down restaurant, and 67 percent said they wouldnât be comfortable shopping in a clothing store. Only 18 percent of respondents were in favor of reopening movie theaters.  State orders donât necessarily dictate behavior  While governors have issued guidelines for reopening their states, businesses and customers have been slow to return in many locales.  One of the earliest states to relax restrictions was Georgia, where a group of southwestern counties are suffering through some of the highest per capita covid-19 death rates in the country. Gov. Brian Kemp (R) allowed spas, hair salons, tattoo parlors, bowling alleys and gyms to reopen on April 24. As of April 30, it did not appear that most Georgians immediately flocked out to get haircuts and hit weight rooms. On average, they were still staying home 86 percent of the time, compared with 92 percent at their early-April peak.  Some states are starting to leave home more than others  Share of time spent at home, for the seven-day period ending on each date  New Jersey South Dakota Select a state: Michigan  In New Jersey, second only to New York in covid-19 deaths, people are spending 96 percent of their time at home, just 1.7 percent less than at the peak. That is both the highest stay-home percentage and the smallest change of any state. Gov. Phil Murphy (D) reopened state parks and golf courses on May 2, but his stay-at-home order is still in effect.  Montanans, by contrast, are going out 10 percent more compared with the peak, the largest change in any state. The state has reported 456 covid-19 cases and 16 deaths as of May 5. Gov. Steve Bullock (D) has allowed retail and churches to reopen and will allow restaurants and schools to open May 7.  Alaskans and South Dakotans are spending the least time at home, 80 percent on average. South Dakota Gov. Kristi L. Noem was one of seven governors to never issue a stay-at-home order. The state has one of the largest coronavirus clusters in the country, at a Smithfield pork-producing plant in Sioux Falls.  Variations on how people move around within states are common and sometimes large, and they often â but not always â follow the pattern of virus outbreaks.  In Florida, people in the populous southern counties of Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach, where most of the stateâs covid-19 cases have been concentrated and where beaches remain closed, are spending about 4 percent more time away from home than in early April. But people in the adjacent counties of Collier and Monroe, which includes the Florida Keys, were out of their houses 13 percent more as of April 30 than at the peak.  [Where people have died of covid-19 by county]  Areas of Georgia around Atlanta showed almost no decrease, led by Forsyth County, which barely budged from its peak of 97 percent at home. By contrast, people in rural Dooly County in the central part of the state were going out 12 percent more than they had at their stay-home peak, despite having a covid-19 death rate that is 19 times higher than Forsythâs.  Qaadir Larke, owner of the Quad Barbershop in Atlanta, gives Brandon Lewis a haircut on April 24. (Kevin D. Liles for The Washington Post)  In Arizonaâs La Paz County, residents are away from home 25 percent more than they were at the peak â the largest change of any county in the country â and theyâre home just 57 percent of the time, roughly the same rate as in early March. In Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, the difference is just 4 percent off the peak, and as of April 30, people were still home 90 percent of the time.  In general, people in rural areas are away more than people in urban and suburban areas, in large part because stores, services and essential workplaces are much farther away and delivery services are rare or nonexistent. But the trend lines are very similar across all types of places.  The data clearly shows that when Americans were told it was time to stay home, most people did. It also indicates that they are deciding for themselves when to go back out.  About this story  Data for this story was provided by SafeGraph, a company that aggregates location data from tens of millions of devices and compares it with building footprints. The Post analyzed its social distancing metrics data set to estimate the share of time spent at home for each county.  The raw numbers fluctuate from day-to-day and county-to-county, and some counties have far fewer devices than others. To account for these challenges, we adjusted the device counts based on population and performed a multilevel regression using a random effects model on the county, state and national levels. Because people tend to leave their homes far more on weekdays than weekends, we chose to calculate a seven-day rolling average, which results in each âdayâ of data including five week and two weekend days.  This analysis relies on defining a âhomeâ location for every device. SafeGraph does this by finding the usual nighttime location of each device over the course of six weeks. It then buckets that location into a grid of roughly 150-meter-wide boxes across the country. When the device remains in that box, it is considered as being home. Of course this is not perfect, but in aggregate and at scale, SafeGraphâs at-home numbers track with other data sources, including location-data research published by other companies and public polling.  Urbanization figures are based on county designations from the National Center for Health Statisticsâs urban-rural classification scheme.

"Amid an increase in demand for online shopping during the coronavirus pandemic, Amazon reported earlier that its sales jumped 27 percent to $75.5bn in March compared with last year and the company projects that its income will increase to $81bn.  Sputnik spoke about Amazon's success with Laurence Kotlikoff, a professor of Economics at Boston University.  Sputnik: According to reports, Jeff Bezos is set to be the world's first trillionaire. In your view, what are the main reasons that Amazon has been able to maintain its position on the market amid the pandemic?  Laurence Kotlikoff: The worry that people have about in-store shopping is the main reason. So it's very good news for Amazon, but really terrible days for retail outlets.  They are blocked in Boston and in Moscow, you're gonna find everything shut down. It's a ghost town. And every city in the US, with some exceptions in states that have decided to ignore the danger or the risk, they may find that they made a big mistake.  There are some countries that are able to continue maintaining retail outlets as they did before. But for the most part, we've got France, Italy, US, UK shut down. So the only way it can get the products is... over the internet from Amazon because I couldn't go down and try it out in IKEA as the store's been closed.  I do think that there's a question here whether these companies like Amazon need to be nationalised, to tell you the truth because it's a public marketplace.  The marketplace needs to be organised by governments. Some shops are not operating in a lot of countries on Sunday or Saturday, the weekends, because it's a day of rest for the workers. You don't want to have some people go to some stores if they are closed on Saturday and others are open.  It doesn't make sense. You want to coordinate. So if I go to the butcher shop, I can also walk across the street, go to the shoe store on the same day at the same hour. Otherwise, you don't get the same level of economic activity. So I think Amazon needs to be nationalised. And also the concentration of wealth going to one person or a set of people is not healthy for any country.  Sputnik: But what is the key element of Amazon’s success in comparison to any other company in this field?  Laurence Kotlikoff: What is their big advantage? They got in first. What is the big advantage of Facebook? They got in there first. It was random.  What about, a lot of companies that have been successful. We're just like a step ahead of the competition. But it's like a market where only one player can play. It makes sense to have one place as people don't want to go online to 20 different websites to see if they can find out what they can buy.  Sputnik: What impact can Amazon's success have on other competing firms on the US market?  Laurence Kotlikoff: Well, they can do what it has been doing. Same with realy big stores like Walmart. You can put small retailers out of business. Such stores as Walmart, Costco and IKEA are big box stores that are exploiting their natural monopolies.  So if you have a lot of small stores in a nice little town in the countryside and then maybe a Walmart... all the small stores in this little town suffer dramatically, and then the town is basically boarded up.  We have to think about, what kind of a society we want to have? People just buying from one company on the internet, buying from a couple of huge stores and having no community life, no towns, everybody just living inside their apartments or homes?  Is that the vision of our national urban planning that we're striving for or are we trying to maintain our way of life? Think about Europe. If you are in France or England, there are a few box stores, but they're pretty remote compared to what we have in the US.  It's a public good for everybody. Everybody can go out to the countryside and enjoy it. But then they (box stores) arrived in the Cotswolds, in the U.K. or the countryside of France.  In the US, you have to drive from the East Coast about a third way across the country to have that experience. I mean, there are places you can go in remote parts of New York state. We have a sprawling suburban system here.  We have decided that anybody can put up any kind of house, any kind of business on any road in any part of the country.  Sputnik: In your view, what can be done by the government and local authorities to help other companies keep afloat during this crisis?  Laurence Kotlikoff: During this crisis, we need to explain something to you that is a little different from the standard answer you might be expecting, which is we need to find a way to capture or kill this virus. And there is a method for doing that, which is very straightforward. Suppose you had the ability to give everybody a test every single day so if they were negative, you could give them a rating bracelet to wear during the day, and they could go back to work, school, go to movies, shop. And if they were red, if they were testing positive, they'd have to stay inside until they tested green again and then they could go out.  That would immediately mean that everybody on the outside would be safe to interact with. Everybody on the inside would be trying to survive this thing, getting health care and free fruit right now. That's an example of containing and killing the virus. Within a few weeks, we would have no virus problem.  It would have been killed off. The people with the virus would have either survived or passed away, unfortunately. And the people outside would be virus-free. Now, there are issues of false negatives in the testing, but this protocol would work even under those conditions because you have it retesting people every day, so you'll catch the false negatives, any kinds of mistakes. Statistically, the transmission rate will go to zero very, very quickly. We do not have the ability to test everybody every day. That's 7.6 billion tests a day around the world. But we have something that's almost as effective, basic as effective, which is called group testing, where you take 60 households and you pull together, you have them spit into the same cup - that's a household sample.  And then you add a reagent to that and then you take each cup, each household sample from 60 different households and you mix all that together. And now you have one batch sample, one called a sample, one group sample and you test that.  And if it's negative now, you can give a green bracelet to probably another 50 people in that household.  You've used one test to clear one hundred and fifty people. That's an enormous deficiency. A hundred and fifty to one efficiency. So we could do a group household testing in our country with six million tests, which we can get to within a couple weeks.  We could solve this problem in a month if we use them with intelligence and organized, and make it voluntary. So this is really not that hard.  Clearly, there's other ways to try and fight this: social distancing and masking... but we're not compliant.",0
"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) took to Twitter Monday to explain in clear terms to a liberal commentator why the “Obamagate” scandal is such a huge deal.  Gabriel Sherman, an opinion writer for the left-wing magazine Vanity Fair, was apparently confused about what conservatives find to be unseemly about the Obama administration’s unmasking of American citizens, including retired Gen. Michael Flynn, in December 2016. Flynn, who was tapped to be President Donald Trump’s first national security adviser, was surveilled in conversation with former Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.  “Serious questions for Trumpers,” Sherman wrote on Twitter last Friday. “What is the scandal of unmasking an American official caught on an intercept discussing US sanctions policy with Ambassador of a hostile foreign country that had just launched a massive cyber attack on our election?”  Uhh, he was the incoming National Security Advisor & a 3-star general. He’s SUPPOSED to discuss sanctions policy. That’s his job. The unmasking was part of outgoing admin launching a massive sting operation to try to entrap him. Maybe this helps: imagine Bush doing same to Obama. https://t.co/ofKNYvrRKl — Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) May 18, 2020  Sherman attempted to explain away the matter by suggesting that to unmask an American “caught” communicating with a foreign official of a hostile country is routine, even advisable. But the question frames the matter incorrectly. – READ MORE  Listen to the insightful Thomas Paine Podcast Below --",0
"Russia becomes new hotspot on the map of coronavirus pandemic  This week, many countries in Europe have started lifting the restrictions that had been introduced in connection with the spread of the coronavirus infection. It does not mean that the pandemic has been defeated: a new “hot spot” is beginning to emerge more and more clearly on the continent. Unfortunately, it goes about Russia.  177 160 confirmed cases of COVID-2019 infection  Of these, 11,231 were detected in the last 24 hours.  More than half of those infected are still in Moscow.  Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin says:  ""The fact that we have identified so many infected people is a huge plus, but not a minus, because it means that infected people are quarantined in a timely manner, and the spread of the virus is slowing down.""  Another “plus” in comparison with other countries is the relatively low mortality rate among coronavirus patients:  1,625 people have died in the country during the epidemic (as of May 8, 2020)  According to the authorities, the outbreak of the epidemic in Russia started later than in many other countries, and Russia had time to get prepared for the challenge.  On May 7, Russia was ranked fifth in the world in the number of COVID-19 cases. Nevertheless, the Russian authorities decided to gradually lift quarantine restrictions. For example, courts will resume their work from May 12. Industrial and construction companies will start operating in Moscow too. However, the quarantine restrictions will not touch upon citizens and small businesses. On the contrary, the measures will be toughened, and the Russians will have to pay for those restrictions from their own pockets.  From May 12, Moscow is introducing the mask regime in the city. One will be required to wear a face mask or a respirator to be able to use the metro or public transport. In addition, one will have to wear gloves. To comply with these requirements, every Muscovite will have to spend at least 2,000 rubles a month.",0
"Mayor Lori Lightfoot said Friday she’s looking at a “range of potential revenue-generating options” to cover declining revenues and rising costs tied to the coronavirus.  Last month, Lightfoot vowed to be “straightforward and very transparent” with Chicagoans if and when she concluded tax increases were needed to plug the giant hole in her 2020 budget caused by the stay-at-home shutdown of the city’s economy.  On Friday, the tough talk began.  “We’re looking at a range of potential revenue-generating options. Look, the reality is, I don’t think there’s any city budget across the country that is not gonna have to look at one-time measures to put yourself back on track,” the mayor said.  “We’d like to avoid those in this administration. But, the truth is, we’re probably gonna have to look at those as well given the magnitude of the challenge that we’re facing — not only to make sure that we’re steady for 2020 but looking to 2021 and beyond.”  Lightfoot said increasing property taxes is “always the last choice,” even though it is the most reliable source of revenue. But it is “particularly the last choice in this environment, when people are really, really suffering” and unemployment has risen to levels not seen since the Great Depression.  “The number of landlords that are worried about foreclosure. The number of renters that are worried about being able to make the rent. If we raise property taxes, that has a cascading effect on the ecosystem — on landlords and renters at a time when neither can afford it,” she said.  With property taxes off the table, where will Lightfoot turn for revenue?  She would only say, “The reality is that, when you have to have revenue, it’s going to impact someone — and probably someones plural. But we’re looking at efficiencies that we save internally first. I still believe that you can’t go out and talk to the taxpayers about sacrifice if you’re not making commonsense sacrifices within city government.”  For weeks after the stay-at-home shutdown, Lightfoot said Chicago was well-positioned to weather the storm of increased costs and declining revenues tied to the coronavirus pandemic without blowing a giant hole in her precariously balanced budget.  She repeatedly said “no one revenue stream is more than 13%” and that all of the “economically sensitive” revenues together total just 25%.  Her claims about city finances ignored the fact that when the stock market drops and city pension funds don’t meet their expected investment returns, Chicago taxpayers make up the difference.  The mayor even ridiculed former mayoral challenger Paul Vallas for writing an opinion column claiming Chicago was “facing a code-red fiscal crisis” and Lightfoot’s “claim that Chicago’s budget is in good shape strains credulity.”  In a stinging public put-down, Lightfoot referred to Vallas as “desperate to be relevant” during the crisis and said he “probably hasn’t touched a city budget, doesn’t know the nuances, in probably two decades.”  Vallas served as city revenue director, budget director and Chicago Public Schools CEO under former Mayor Richard M. Daley.  On April 7, the mayor changed her tune and acknowledged the possibility of a midyear budget fix.  On Friday, she again refused to project the size of Chicago’s budget shortfall, saying the situation was still “unbelievably fluid” and an initial estimate would end up too low and need to be revised upward at a time when laid-off Chicagoans are struggling to pay rent and put food on the table.  “A lot of it depends on when we reopen, who reopens, what the revenue stream is from the businesses that do reopen. This is not simple math. It’s very, very complicated and it’s fluid. We want to put something out that we can stand behind,” she said.  “I’m a cautious person. I want to make sure we understand the full magnitude of the challenge. Has there been an impact? Of course there has been. Has it been significant? Yes. What that looks like precisely, we still need to look at some other data that just hasn’t come in yet.”  Lightfoot said a “big, important, determining factor” in the need to raise local taxes will be what, if any, revenue replacement relief comes from Congress in the next round of stimulus money.  She noted the Federal Reserve has also “opened up potential borrowing for municipalities” like Chicago, and she is “still working with them to understand what that possibility would look like” while maintaining dialogue with Wall Street ratings agencies.",1

"Illinois Department of Public Health head Dr. Ngozi Ezike on Sunday delivered an emotional Mother’s Day message for her church in west suburban LaGrange — detailing that more than 1,000 mothers have died from COVID-19 in Illinois.  The weekend marked the first time in eight weeks in which Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Ezike didn’t stand before the cameras for daily COVID-19 briefings. Instead, Ezike — a mother of four — spent her Sunday delivering a lengthy sermon for Hope Church via their Facebook page.  “This Mother’s Day is especially challenging. That’s putting it ever so mildly,” Ezike said. “No one will ever forget Mother’s Day 2020.”  “Many of us can’t visit and celebrate this day in person with our mothers in the traditional way. For some, a visit would be putting our loved mother, our beloved mother, at risk of contracting this virus that we’ve all become intimately aware of,” Ezike said. “Some of our mothers are in a nursing home, where visitation is now banned, again, for their safety. Maybe your mother is no longer with us on this side of Earth.”  The state has lost 3,406 people to COVID-19, including 1,553 in the nursing homes.  “And then there are over 1,000 mothers that we have lost in Illinois alone to this awful coronavirus in just the last two months,” Ezike said.  Ezike said her spirituality helped her cope with the loss of her father, who died in February in California just before the pandemic began its rapid spread. And the health director said she’s “running on fumes with little to no sleep” and is humbled and grateful to be leading the state’s response to the virus.  Ezike heads the state’s Department of Public Health after being the Cook County Juvenile Detention Center’s medical director during 15 years working for Cook County Health. An internist and pediatrician, she oversaw medical care at the Cook County Juvenile Detention Center during the 2009 H1N1 flu virus pandemic.  “Who am I to even be here before you? A daughter of poor African immigrants, born in California, and now leading the state of Illinois through a pandemic, the likes of which we haven’t seen in 100 years,” Ezike said. “The impossible becomes possible when you see that God is in it. The fact that I’m involved in this pandemic with all my imperfections flaring and glaring is just because I am part of his perfect plan.”",1
"NEW YORK — Just 0.7% of Major League Baseball employees tested positive for antibodies to COVID-19, the illness caused by the new coronavirus.  Results were based from about 5,600 completed records from employees of 26 clubs. Samples were obtained on April 14 and 15.  “It allows us to get a peek of the nation-wide prevalence,” said Dr. Jay Bhattacharya at Stanford, one the study’s leaders, said Sunday.  The start of the baseball season has been delayed because of the virus outbreak. There’s no timetable for when the season might begin.  Sixty people tested positive in the raw data, and adjustments were made for false positives and false negatives. Bhattacharya said the survey had a 0.5% false positive rate.  Antibodies are produced by a person’s immune system if they have been infected by a virus.  MLB employees have been less affected than their surrounding communities have been, Bhattacharya said.  The University of Southern California and the Sports Medicine Research and Testing Laboratory in Salt Lake City also led the study.  Data for players was not broken out. The study was not representative of the overall population, given 95% of the participants were under 65 and few reported comorbidities.  MLB team doctors looked at results last month. The goal of the study was to better determine how widespread COVID-19 is, which could aid governments and health professionals in their evaluation of when to lift stay-at-home orders.  The Chicago Cubs, Cincinnati, Colorado and Miami did not participate, Bhattacharya said.  “The MLB population is a special population. They’re not representative of every city that they’re in,” Bhattacharya said. “They also are more well to do than a typical population, so it’s not representative. ... They have an organization that allows us to sample in just two days time in so many places all at once. And that’s unique.”  “I don’t get the sense that they are doing it to benefit them,” Bhattacharya said. “If the economy opens up, sports are huge gatherings. So in a sense it benefits everybody. I actually think they’re doing it because they want to contribute to public health knowledge.”  Each club was given approximately 350 tests.  “To be able to have a window into how widespread the epidemic is in so many places all at once is a really special thing,” Bhattacharya said.  AP Baseball Writer Janie McCauley contributed to this report.",1
"In Time For Mother's Day, Belgium Will Allow Up To 4 Guests At Home  Enlarge this image toggle caption Francisco Seco/AP Francisco Seco/AP  The games some people have been playing on social media — choosing who they'd want to be quarantined with — have become real life in Belgium.  Under strict lockdown since March 16, including home confinement except for essential journeys, Belgium's controls have been some of the tightest in Europe. But it's worked — after hitting one of the highest death rates in the world, the nation's infection rate and death toll have dropped steadily since a peak in early April.  The decline led Prime Minister Sophie Wilmès to announce this past week that along with letting all stores reopen on May 11, certain social distancing guidelines will be relaxed.  Beginning on Sunday for Mother's Day, Wilmès said, each household will be allowed to host up to four other people, preferably all within the same family, as long as social distancing is maintained. These groups cannot have contact with anyone else. Authorities describe it as kind of a ""contract"" between two households that will serve to limit any potential spread of COVID-19.  Of course, choosing can be a delicate process; no one wants to hurt the feelings of a friend or relative if they don't make the cut.  Seventeen-year-old music student Carla Vandersteen says her friends started texting immediately about getting together. She's made her ""list,"" consisting of the three friends who live closest to her, but still thinks it's smartest not to go out.  ""At least [to protect] your parents!"" she urges. She says it would be so hard to see her best friends and not hug them. She fears many young people will now act like restrictions are completely lifted.  Many Belgians have expressed confusion about whether there's any flexibility in the new rules.  As the parents of three young children, Daniel and Marie Bach joke that as a family of five, they're mathematically ruled out of being any other household's significant others.  ""I think they mean 'more or less four,'"" Marie suggests with a laugh. ""You can't just abandon your last child — it can't be so.""  While they are looking forward to some company, Daniel acknowledges ""it's a gamble"" for authorities to allow social bubbles to expand. ""A pretty big one, really.""  Then there's the dilemma of Mother's Day: visit with mom on Sunday and have her locked in as one of your ""four,"" or save that spot for someone else?  Veronique Petit says she and her husband will do some creative counting so that their two adult children can visit them and they can still visit their parents.  ""It's impossible"" to follow these rules, Petit says in exasperation. ""So we're going to cheat a little. I think all Belgians are going to cheat.""  Police have admitted they won't be able to verify whether visitations are being carried out correctly, but authorities say if infections spike, restrictions will have to be tightened again.",1

"WASHINGTON — As requests for ventilators from the national stockpile reached a crescendo in late March, President Donald Trump made what seemed like a bold claim: His administration would have 100,000 within 100 days.  At the time, the Department of Health and Human Services had not ordered any new ventilators since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in January. But records show that over the following three weeks, the agency scrambled to turn Trump’s pledge into a reality, spending nearly $3 billion to spur U.S. manufacturers to crank out the breathing machines at an unprecedented pace.  An analysis of federal contracting data by The Associated Press shows the agency is now on track to exceed 100,000 new ventilators by around July 13, about a week later than the 100-day deadline Trump first gave on March 27.  By the end of 2020, the administration is expected to take delivery of nearly 200,000 new ventilators, based on the AP’s review of current federal purchasing contracts. That would more than double the estimated 160,000 ventilators hospitals across the U.S. had before the pandemic.  “We became the king of ventilators, thousands and thousands of ventilators,” Trump boasted in an April 29 speech.  But over the past month, demand for ventilators has decreased even as the U.S. death toll from the novel coronavirus has surged past 80,000. After observing unusually high death rates for coronavirus victims who were put on ventilators, many doctors are using them only as a last resort.  That’s raising the unexpected prospect that the United States could soon be awash in surplus ventilators, so much so the White House is now planning to ship thousands overseas to help boost the virus response of other nations.  In a speech to Republican members of Congress on Friday, the president credited his son-in-law, White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, with heading up the effort to purchase the ventilators.  “We built, and we built, and we built,” Trump said. “Now we have nine factories that are throwing out ventilators at numbers that nobody can believe. It was really — there’s not been anything like that, since the Second World War, where we did the same thing with other types of product.”  Daniel Adelman, a professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business who teaches health care analytics, said the U.S. government is now buying more than twice the number of ventilators it needs, even under a worst-case scenario forecasting the spread of COVID-19.  But Adelman said mathematical models cannot predict with certainty how many ventilators will be needed if there is a resurgence of the coronavirus later in the year or if there is another pandemic in the future.  “It seems incongruent with the forecasts that you’re seeing,” Adelman said of the government purchases. “I’d probably rather they order too many rather than ordering too few.”  In patients with severe cases of COVID-19, the virus attacks the lungs, causing fluid to collect in tiny air sacs called alveoli. That makes it difficult for the lungs to transfer oxygen from the air to the blood, which can be deadly. To treat these low oxygen levels, doctors have historically relied on ventilators.  The Strategic National Stockpile, the federal government’s emergency reserve of medical supplies, had about 16,660 ventilators ready to deploy at the start of March, with an additional 2,400 out for maintenance.  By the middle of the month, health officials and governors in states with the worst virus outbreaks began expressing concerns that the supply of breathing machines could run out, potentially leaving thousands of critically ill patients gasping for air.  Among those calling for additional ventilators was Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D-N.Y.), who predicted on March 24 that all of the ventilators in his state would be in use, and patients in need would be left without proper treatment. Cuomo said projections showed New York would need at least 30,000 additional ventilators to get through the mid-April peak of the outbreak. At that point, FEMA had sent New York 400.  Trump expressed skepticism at Cuomo’s figures even as his administration rushed to send New York 4,000 additional ventilators — about one-quarter of the nation’s entire emergency stockpile. Still, Cuomo pleaded for more.  “You pick the 26,000 people who are going to die,” Cuomo said at a news conference,  It wasn’t just New York, however. Similarly dire projections of a ventilator shortfall were also then circulating within the White House.  “The scariest day of my life was about a month ago when, after a long day of meetings, my team told me that we were going to be needing 130,000 ventilators; that we were short hundreds of thousands of ventilators,” Trump recounted in an April 14 briefing. “I had governors requesting unreasonable sums that the federal government just didn’t have.”  By late March, a bipartisan chorus of state governors and members of Congress were calling on the president to exercise his emergency authority under the Defense Production Act to force U.S. companies to produce ventilators.  Trump had resisted invoking the Korean War-era law, which grants the president sole authority to direct U.S. industrial production of critical supplies in times of national emergency, saying the private sector was stepping up production of ventilators and other medical supplies on its own.  But on March 27, Trump changed course, announcing that he would invoke the Defense Production Act to produce ventilators, which meant companies would have to give priority to federal orders over other customers.  “In the next 100 days — well, first of all, we’ve already delivered thousands of them — but within the next 100 days, we will either make or get, in some form, over 100,000 additional units,” Trump said.  By the start of April, FEMA officials confirmed to the House Oversight and Reform Committee that demand for ventilators would soon outpace the available supply. To ration what was left, FEMA Administrator Peter Gaynor directed that the remaining ventilators in the national stockpile be designated as a “strategic national asset” — to be provided to states only on a case-by-case basis where hospitals could demonstrate an “exigent need” to sustain life within 72 hours.  Federal purchasing records show that three months into the pandemic, HHS, which includes the Strategic National Stockpile, had not yet placed any orders for new ventilators in 2020.  That changed within three days of Trump’s March 27 edict, with HSS signing a $350 million deal with Zoll Medical Corp. Records show a flurry of about a dozen big orders with other ventilator makers over the next two weeks, most of them no-bid contracts exempted from the typical federal purchasing rules due to the national emergency.  In a typical year, U.S. companies produce about 29,000 ventilators, according to data cited by the White House. Though several domestic manufacturers had already announced they were adding extra shifts and hiring additional workers to ramp up production, AP’s analysis of HHS contracts show that even with the emergency no-bid orders the traditional medical device makers would deliver about 73,990 new ventilators by July 6 — the 100-day mark since Trump’s March 27 pledge.  It was clear additional industrial capacity would be needed to get 100,000 units by the president’s deadline.  General Motors, which had shut down auto production, had already entered into a partnership on March 20 with Ventec Life Systems, a small ventilator company, to simplify an off-the-shelf design for rapid production at GM’s Kokomo, Indiana, plant.  Though GM had announced it was “working night and day” to launch production, Trump accused CEO Mary Barra via Twitter of dragging her feet, and revived his long-running feud with the company over its 2019 closure of an Ohio factory that Trump had pledged to save.  “As usual with ‘this’ General Motors, things just never seem to work out,” Trump tweeted on March 27. “General Motors MUST immediately open their stupidly abandoned Lordstown plant in Ohio, or some other plant, and START MAKING VENTILATORS, NOW!!!!!!”  GM had sold the Lordstown factory in 2019.  The president also took aim at Ford Motor Co., tweeting that the rival automaker should also “GET GOING ON VENTILATORS, FAST!!!!!!”  On April 8, HHS announced it had reached a $489.4 million deal with GM to produce 30,000 ventilators by the end of August, with the first 6,132 delivered by June 1.  The following week, HHS announced a $336 million contract with Ford and General Electric, which teamed up to make 50,000 of GE Healthcare’s ventilators by July 13.  Assuming all the companies meet their deadlines, AP’s analysis shows the national stockpile should surpass 100,000 new ventilators by mid-July.  HHS declined to release to AP its contracts with ventilator producers without a Freedom of Information Act request, a legal process that can often take months or even years.  But AP’s analysis of the limited contract data available online and figures taken from HHS media releases shows the agency will spend more than $2.9 billion for 198,890 ventilators by the end of 2020, an average per-unit cost of $14,618.  Whether that’s a good deal for U.S. taxpayers is difficult to determine because medical device makers generally don’t publish their prices. HHS is buying at least 13 different models of ventilators from 10 different companies, all with different capabilities, features and accessories.  When AP sought details from HHS about the per-unit cost of four models from manufacturer Hamilton Medical, the agency’s press office provided figures that did not add up to the totals announced in earlier media releases. An HHS spokesperson said the previously provided figures were wrong and would be corrected on the agency’s website.  AP found several instances where the U.S. government had purchased the same models of ventilators before the pandemic. For example, contracting data does show that in December the Department of Defense bought a single, portable ventilator from Zoll Medical for $12,260.  Under its current contract with Zoll, HHS is purchasing 18,900 of the same model for slightly more than $350 million. That works out to about $18,500 each, which would be a more than 50 percent increase from what the Pentagon paid less than five months ago.  A HHS spokeswoman said Friday the government was paying about $12,100 for each ventilator, and that the additional money was for hoses, face masks and other related supplies needed to treat COVID-19 patients. The ventilators also came with a wheeled plastic case with power port, which cost an additional $722 each, according to HHS.  The Defense Department did not respond to questions Friday about whether its 2019 ventilator deliveries also included accessories.  Zoll’s top executive said his company’s pricing had remained consistent.  “Zoll is supplying the U.S. government with its requested products at our usual and customary government pricing, absorbing the additional costs associated with Zoll’s rapid increase in production capacity,” Zoll CEO Jonathan Rennert said Friday. “We are focused on fulfilling the government’s order on time and meeting this urgent public need.”  Erik Gordon, a business professor at the University of Michigan who studies the medical device industry, said ventilator companies are probably incurring increased costs as they ramp up production to meet high demand. Manufacturers haven’t had time to bulk buy additional parts and probably had to add workers to make more of the machines, he said.  U.S. ventilator makers have raised production from a rate of about 700 per week in February to about 5,000 per week by early April, according to the Advanced Medical Technology Association, an industry trade group.  “If you don’t have time to change your manufacturing processes to get those economies of scale, you get there by brute force, extra labor,” said Gordon, who teaches a course in monetizing medical device ideas. “Your costs actually go up, not down.”  With the federal government buying most of the new ventilators being made in the U.S., state governments and hospital systems urgently seeking the machines have often been forced to go through middlemen or foreign suppliers.  Cuomo has compared the free-for-all bidding to going on eBay, and said during a March 31 briefing that New York had ordered 17,000 ventilators from China for $25,000 each.  “We are paying $25,000 per ventilator, and we are broke,” Cuomo said. “The last thing I want to do is buy a single ventilator I don’t need.”  More than a month later, only 2,500 of the Chinese machines have been delivered, according to Cuomo’s office. In a separate case, New York officials are trying to recover another $69.1 million paid to a Silicon Valley electrical engineer who promised 1,450 ventilators that never materialized.  With nearly 200,000 new ventilators set for delivery to the federal stockpile by the end of the year, Trump is declaring victory. But it is now unclear whether the stockpile of new ventilators will be needed.  In the little more than a month since Trump announced the buying spree, a series of medical studies has spurred questions about whether ventilators are effective at saving the lives of critically ill COVID-19 patients.  A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine on March 30 found that only 1 of 7 patients older than 70 who were put on a ventilator survived. For patients younger than 70, just 36% lived.  In New York City, state officials say 80% or more of coronavirus patients placed on the machines died.  The studies have caused doctors to reevaluate the use of ventilators in favor of less intensive forms of respiratory support.  Trump administration officials say the new ventilators could still prove valuable if the virus outbreak were to intensify into a second wave after the warm summer months.  “It’s very important that we have a completely refreshed and a comprehensive stockpile going into the fall,” Dr. Deborah Birx, a medical adviser on the White House Coronavirus Task Force, said at a briefing on April 21. “I think that’s why we’ve continued to bring in those shipments and work on the ventilators so that those would be available not only for the United States but certainly if other partner countries have this level of tragedy.”  Trump said he intends to ship thousands of the breathing machines overseas, where the needs are greater.  On Tuesday, Mexico said it received a shipment of ventilators from the United States. Trump said last week Russia is also set to receive U.S. ventilators, along with other countries.  “People dying because they don’t have ventilators, and they’re not equipped to do what we did,” Trump said Friday. “So we’re giving thousands and thousands of these ventilators away to many countries that have suffered greatly: Italy, France, Spain, so many countries. And Nigeria called. Tremendous problems in Nigeria. Tremendous problems all over. And so they’re very happy.”  Krisher reported from Detroit.

"For those waiting for more good news for this outbreak, recent reports may be just that as the three drug cocktail consisting of the HIV medication lopinavir-ritonavir, the hepatitis therapy drug ribavirin and the multiple sclerosis treatment interferon-beta is suggested to have successfully cleared COVID-19 in one weeks time.  Hong Kong scientists have completed a clinical study in which administering this cocktail of antiviral medications to patients with mild coronavirus symptoms ""may rapidly suppress the amount of virus in a patient's body.""  ""Early triple antiviral therapy was safe and superior to lopinavir–ritonavir alone in alleviating symptoms and shortening the duration of viral shedding and hospital stay in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19,"" the study authors wrote, adding that ""future clinical study of a double antiviral therapy with interferon beta-1b as a backbone is warranted"" for a complete overview.  As published in the Lancet this 127 patient open label study had 86 patients randomly assigned to the experimental cocktail treatment group and 41 to the control group who only received the HIV therapy drug lopinavir-ritonavir; age, gender, and baseline demographics in each group were similar with fever and a dry cough being among the most common symptoms. After only seven days of being administered the experiments cocktail treatment the patients tested negative for COVID-19 according to the researchers.  ""For the primary endpoint of time from start of study treatment to negative nasopharyngeal swab, the combination group had a significantly shorter median time (7 days) than the control group (12 days),"" the study authors noted. ""For the virological outcome, the combination treatment was associated with significantly shorter time to negative viral load in all specimens when assessed individually (nasopharyngeal swab, posterior oropharyngeal saliva, throat swab, and stool samples) as well as in all specimens combined. All urine samples tested negative for viral load.""  Previously established side effects of the medications were being closely monitored, however the drugs have a long standing track record for safety according to medical officials, and on average patients in the cocktail group felt better after 4 days.  ""Despite the concern of major side effects arising from a combination of three drugs, no significant differences in incidence of adverse events between treatment groups were reported in our cohort of 127 patients,"" the study authors wrote.  ""No haemolysis occurred from the short duration of low dose ribavirin. We did not use triple combination for patients who started treatment 7 days or more after symptom onset because of the concerns about the proinflammatory side effects of interferon beta-1b – despite that at most, three doses were used for each patient,"" they added, noting that ""liver dysfunction was observed in about 14% of these patients and it was mild and self-limiting, except in one patient in the control group, in whom the biochemical hepatitis warranted the discontinuation of lopinavir–ritonavir treatment.""  This study was independently reviewed by experts who concurred that these findings were positive, but suggest that larger clinical trials are required for greater certainty of the cocktail’s effectiveness and safety. Other diseases have a record of being treated successfully with a cocktail of drugs, the experts believe that it may also be the case for COVID-19, results are promising and warrant adding interferon beta to the list of evidence based treatments for the coronavirus.",0
"Going stir-crazy in quarantine? You’re not alone. Celebrities are cooped up in their homes across the country just like the rest of us. As we collectively navigate this uncharted territory, USA TODAY presents Quarantine Diaries, which give readers a peek into how our favorite stars are spending their time at home.  Today's diarist is ""Dancing With the Stars"" six-time champion Derek Hough, who romped to ""Chim Chim Cher-ee"" with girlfriend and fellow quarantiner Hayley Erbert on Sunday's ""The Disney Family Singalong 2."" (The couple re-created ""Be Our Guest"" for the first singalong last month.) Here's what life is like for multi-threat entertainer Hough, 34, who appears as a judge on NBC's ""World of Dance"" fourth season (returns May 26). – As told to Bryan Alexander  8 a.m. Sometimes we sleep in, but often we get up about 8 with our cat nuzzling our faces. The bed becomes this animal affair with two cats (Lily and Palo) and dog Romie jumps in at about 7. Most of the time, we don't have breakfast. I drink this green shake in the morning, my favorite thing, with super-green powder and vitamins. I mix it with mango-flavored Pre-Workout. It's healthy and gives a little boost.  Staying Apart, Together: Are you breathing correctly? Plus, the healing power of the Olympics  9:00 a.m. The thing I love doing right now that I've never really had time to do, but I obviously have a lot of time now, is gardening. It's springtime, so everything is blooming. I'm outside for a solid hour in the morning, picking weeds, watering the plants, admiring the new growth. There's something very peaceful and nurturing. It's amazing that gardening is my new favorite thing to do in the morning.  11 a.m. We try work out every day, do something physical. Especially right now. motion equals emotion. Whenever I'm not moving, my brain starts going a little busy. We do something outside or in the garage. I just need to move.  On creating televised routines from home: Choreographing with limited home space has definitely required creativity. But it focuses me. Normally you have a camera operator. But it's just Hayley and me. We have to fix the camera, perform, look at it. And it's like we moved out of frame or the angle's not good. Constant trial and error. Fortunately, we've been part of a lot of shows and tours. So a lot of the costumes didn't make it back to wardrobe, they make it back to our closets. Like those chimney sweep outfits or the Belle costume.  I did see my neighbor outside while I was in full Lumiere costume and I was like, ""Don't even ask me about it."" That was hilarious.  On dancing for stress relief: When I'm dancing professionally or to create something, I'm in that zone. When I'm just dancing for fun, it doesn't look good. I kind of dance like a fool, honestly, like that embarrassing uncle at a wedding. But the truth is, moving around freely with no rules is definitely liberating and makes you feel good.  6 p.m. We start making dinner. I don't know my way around the kitchen at all. I'm a sous chef to Hayley. I call it ""Hayl's Kitchen."" She directs, ""Wash this, watch this, peel this."" We like to watch shows like ""The World's Most Extraordinary Homes"" while we cook. I just love architecture. So there's often times we'll be cooking and I'll fall into a daze watching and she'll be like, ""Babe, we need those things."" And I'm like, ""Sorry, sorry."" But it's fun and nice to create something. I clean up afterward. That way, I feel I've done my part.  Dessert treat: We eat healthy all day. But after dinner is when the candy, popcorn, chips and salsa, and Twizzlers come out. Hayley has made her own ice cream, mint chocolate chip. I was like, ""I didn't know we had that machine."" She made something called S'mores Yumminess. It's graham-cracker crust with marshmallow fluff and chocolate, more graham cracker on top. She bakes it, and it's insane. She's surprising me with these skills.  On working through relationships: After six weeks of being with each other 24/7 is when we started to become like, ""OK, we might've reached our limit here."" But it's been really good, actually. If we don't agree on something or get into an argument, it's very short-lived. Because at this moment of time, we're just thankful for our health and for everything. We don't take that for granted. Also, when you're with somebody, it's not like, ""OK, I'm leaving, I'm going to go cool off out here."" It's like, ""OK, we've got to figure this out as fast as possible."" So it's been good.  What I'm streaming: We knocked out ""Tiger King"" pretty quickly. Fascinating and disturbing. We managed to get through ""Ozark,"" all three seasons. We're loving Netflix's ""Queer Eye,"" which is a great transformational show.  11 p.m. I head to bed at night like 11. This is after we'll watch something on the couch. She's out after like 30 seconds, mouth agape out cold. But I'll watch the movie or the show until about 11.  When quarantine ends: We're going to Yosemite or a national park that is just beautiful. Nature is just the ultimate. Right now with the cats, we're seeing straight up ""National Geographic."" When you watch them all day, you see behavior you've never seen before.

"Due to revenue losses caused by the pandemic, Northwestern University on Monday announced plans to furlough about 250 workers, reduce salaries for university leaders, suspend contributions to retirement plans and draw more heavily on its endowment fund.  The measures were enacted to help address a projected $90 million budget shortfall this year, university leadership said in a message to the Northwestern community.  “Even if we resume on-campus activity in the fall, as we hope to do by phases, we are likely to see a significant shortfall in the 2021 fiscal year as well, perhaps as great as or greater than what we are experiencing this year,” the note signed by President Morton Schapiro said.  University leaders will be taking a 10% to 20% cut in pay. A 5% automatic contribution and 5% matched contribution to retirement plans will be suspended. The 250 workers who are being furloughed are staff members who are unable to work remotely or whose workloads have been significantly reduced.  “We expect to see repercussions from the pandemic for some time. Most of our work involves bringing large numbers of people together — in classrooms, dormitories, hospitals, libraries, laboratories, meeting rooms, concert halls and athletic arenas. As such, a pandemic places extreme pressure on all our major functions and on associated revenue streams,” the message said.  The announcement comes weeks after the university announced other belt-tightening measures that included hiring restrictions, a pause on university travel and discretionary spending, and deferral of most facilities projects.  The university last month decided not to accept $8.5 million in federal stimulus money that it was allocated as part of the CARES Act — a decision that followed the lead of Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, Yale and Duke universities.  Northwestern’s endowment was $11.1 billion last year, the 12th largest in the nation.",1
"A group of Chinese American business leaders has donated 1 million surgical masks to first-responders and others in Chicago, saying Chicagoans did the same thing for China when the coronavirus emerged there at the beginning of the year.  “We are grateful to the frontline responders who are risking their well-being to protect Chicago neighborhoods,” said Citadel Securities CEO Peng Zhao, who organized the donation with his wife Cherry Chen.  The effort follows months of President Donald Trump blaming China for the pandemic.  On Monday, when a Chinese American reporter asked the president why he sees testing for the coronavirus as a “global competition,” he responded, “Maybe that’s a question you should ask China.” On Tuesday, Trump tweeted: “Asian Americans are VERY angry at what China has done to our Country, and the World. Chinese Americans are the most angry of all.”  Zhao and more than a dozen other Chinese American business leaders bought the masks and asked the University of Chicago Crime Lab to help distribute them.  About 750,000 of the masks are going to the Chicago Department of Public Health, which will provide them to Chicago police officers and other city workers who need them, according to the crime lab. More than 500 officers have tested positive for COVID-19, and three have died.  About 100,000 masks will go to the Chicago Public Schools. Masks also are being given to nonprofits that work with at-risk youth.  The distribution of the masks began May 4.  Roseanna Ander, executive director of the crime lab, said the donation comes at a time China is under fire by Trump and others and said, “We all have a common enemy in COVID-19 and a shared interest in stopping its spread, protecting our brave frontline responders and ultimately finding a vaccine.”  Ken Griffin, founder of Citadel and Chicago’s richest man, is paying for cleaning supplies and medical equipment for cops and other first-responders. He also donated $2.5 million to feed Chicago schoolchildren during the pandemic. In early February, he and his companies contributed $7.5 million to help China’s Hubei province, where the pandemic began.",1
"(Reuters) - Health policy experts say the United States must dramatically increase the availability of tests for the coronavirus if it is to safely reopen its economy. U.S. regulators have moved speedily to authorize many new tests, but concerns still remain about tests’ accuracy, and some policymakers say new testing technologies need to proliferate to fully contain the virus.  MOLECULAR DIAGNOSTIC TESTSMolecular diagnostic tests show who has contracted the virus. Most rely on samples collected from patients using nasal swabs. The samples are then analyzed using a method called polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which detects viral RNA. These tests can be highly accurate, in some instances detecting the virus in 95% of cases. The first diagnostic tests to get U.S. regulatory approval required that a sample be shipped back to a laboratory to be analyzed, slowing the speed at which patients could receive results. More recently approved diagnostic tests can be conducted at the same location where the sample is taken and provide results in minutes. Examples:    - Roche cobas SARS-CoV-2Authorized for use by U.S. regulators in March, Roche's website says it is currently shipping around 8 million tests per month. It requires a sample taken by nasal swab be sent back to a lab for analysis. Roche says studies show it can detect very low levels of the virus with 95% accuracy. - Abbott ID Now Approved in late March, Abbott’s rapid, point-of-care molecular diagnostic test can provide results on site to patients within minutes. As of May 4, Abbott said it is producing 50,000 of these tests per day, and plans to ramp up to 2 million by June. A study conducted by the Cleveland Clinic showed the test detected the virus in around 85% of cases. ANTIGEN TESTSEarlier this month, U.S. regulators authorized the first antigen test, a new category of diagnostic test. This type of test scans for proteins that can be found on or inside of a virus. They test samples taken from the nasal cavity using swabs. Antigen tests can detect the virus very quickly and can potentially be produced at lower cost. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says antigen test production can potentially scale to millions per day. But they produce false negatives at a higher rate than molecular diagnostics tests. Examples:- Quidel Corporation Sofia 2 SARS Antigen FIAAuthorized for use earlier this month, Quidel said the test picks up around 80% of COVID-19 cases. ANTIBODY TESTSAntibody tests take small samples of patients’ blood and scan them for antibodies, which the immune system produces in response to a virus. They can be conducted in labs or through on-site tests that provide results in minutes. Antibody tests, also known as serological tests, are not as effective as molecular diagnostic tests in catching COVID-19 at early-stages, when patients may not yet be producing antibodies. But they can confirm if patients previously had the virus and have antibodies that might protect them against future infection. The FDA recently tightened rules on serological test developers after a proliferation of unauthorized tests raised questions about their reliability. Researchers have not confirmed whether recovered patients who are producing antibodies are fully immune to COVID-19.     Examples:- Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG AssayResearchers at the University of Washington School of Medicine say the test, which Abbott launched in April, has a specificity of 99.9% and a sensitivity of 100%, suggesting very few false positives and no false negatives. Abbott has already shipped more than 10 million antibody tests to hospitals and labs.  (Reporting by Carl O'Donnell; Editing by Lincoln Feast.)",1
"Michelle Latona is no hero. She’s a nurse, in the emergency department at Mount Sinai Hospital.  Latona certainly doesn’t consider herself heroic.  “No, I don’t,” she said. “I wake up every morning and I come to work and do my job.”  A job that demands she tend to the sick and the dying for 12 hours at a stretch. To juggle patients, rooms, medicines, doses, equipment, colleagues, hours, breaks, all the time keeping focused on the central task: making people well again.  “We’ve been saving lives the entire time,” she said, admitting that since the COVID-19 pandemic hit Chicago in mid-March, things have changed.  “This is a different time,” she said. “But I’ve continued to show up to work and do what I do.”  Latona never knows what’s coming through the door.  “This is a trauma center,” she said. “We still have gunshots, car accidents. Kids still fall off bunk beds. Now there are extra precautions. We have to go under the assumption that everyone is positive until they’ve proven negative. The COVID adds a little bit of extra stress.”  That “little bit of extra stress” has to be heroic, the modesty of the truly courageous, since most folks feel extra stress going to the supermarket, never mind having to intubate COVID-19 patients in an ongoing worldwide crisis hitting nursing much harder than most professions.  Nurses are the tip of the spear. The National Nurses Union reports at least 50 nurses have died in the United States from the coronavirus, and some 10,000 have been sickened by it. The only reason the death toll isn’t higher is because nurses tend to be younger, and fitter. Latona says her main hobby outside the hospital is working out.  She is one of almost 4 million registered nurses in the United States. Since Tuesday is International Nurses Day, it’s worth mentioning that there are 20 million nurses in the world, according to the World Health Organization.  If you haven’t heard of International Nurses Day, that isn’t because it’s new — the celebration began in 1965. It’s on May 12 because it’s the birthday of British nurse Florence Nightingale, who was in charge of nursing in military hospitals in Turkey during the Crimean War. Like nurses ever since, she had to overcome hostile doctors, who at first would not allow the new female nurses in the hospital wards. And like today, Nightingale battled obstinate authorities to get desperately-needed equipment, which she often dug into her pocket to pay for. Nightingale shrugged off attempts to honor her after the war, taking the collection grateful Londoners had taken up for her benefit and using it to found a nursing school in 1860, the first in the world.  Asked what she likes most about nursing, Latona replied:  “Our team here, we have such a strong team. We’re like family. We’re showing up. We’re picking up extra shifts. We’re filling in holes where we need to. We’re helping each other so much.”  Pandemic hits home  Latona grew up in Bensenville, her father a Mexican immigrant. Before she worked at Mount Sinai, she worked at a clinic for underserved patients. “I just really enjoyed working with that population,” she said. “Low-income, uninsured, immigrants with no paperwork. I could relate. Just because they’re here doesn’t mean they don’t deserve to be cared for.”  Her husband is a lawyer, and they have three young children: two boys, Theodore and Benjamin, 6 and 3, and a girl, Victoria, 22 months.  “My oldest always says, ‘Do you have to go to work?’ I say, ‘Yes, I have to go help sick people.’ He’s said, ‘Mom, I want to go to work to help sick people.’ He understands. All the kids understand when I come home, nobody can touch me until I take a shower.”  Latona feels safe, feels confident coming home to her husband and children.  “I do,” she said. “We feel comfortable. We’re taking the proper precautions. My kids are all really healthy, we have no preexisting conditions. My husband said, ‘Do you want to quarantine in a hotel?’ and I said, ‘Who knows how long I’ll be gone?’ ”  Victoria is named after her mother, “probably my best friend, probably the strongest person. I know.”  “She was a huge caregiver for my kids,” said Latona. Then her mother was diagnosed with COVID-19.  “She got sick back in March, right when this took off,” Latona said. “She was intubated, in the ICU for three weeks.”  Being a nurse, Latona knew what being intubated meant: About 90% of people who go on ventilators don’t survive.  “The worst part was, she was alone. I couldn’t go to the hospital with her,” Latona said. “She is in the ER by herself. She calls me and says, ‘They want to intubate me.’ I immediately started crying, because I knew what that meant. I hung up thinking, ‘Was that the last time I talked to my mother?’”  Latona had to care for everyone but the one person she most wanted to care for.  “It was definitely hard to come to work, seeing everything here; trying to focus, trying not to think of my mom,” said Latona. “I want to be present and care for my patient. Especially knowing what my mom is going through.”  Her mother is off the ventilator and recovering; in an odd way, her getting sick made her daughter an even better nurse.  “The fact my mom is by herself, it makes me more empathetic and understanding of the stress family members are feeling, the panic they are having,” Latona said. “Sometimes we’ll get phone calls from the family, and before you might feel, ‘We’re trying to do work!’ Now there is realization: They’re scared. I completely get it. The patient is scared. The family is scared they can’t be there, and they don’t know what’s going on.”  Second career  Latona wasn’t one of those girls who grew up bandaging her dolls and taking their temperature. Nursing wasn’t on her radar.  “It was actually a second career for me,” she said. She went to Illinois State, studied marketing, soon found herself wrangling the Shrek toys that went into McDonald’s Happy Meals.  “I was thinking: ‘What did I accomplish today?’ I felt very unfulfilled, not happy with it. I was thinking: ‘I want to do something to help people.’ I always liked science, and I always liked people. I was having a conversation with my mom, and she said, ‘I wish I had gone to nursing school.’ That got me thinking that’s the route I want to go. I went to nursing school.”  And what part of nursing is more fulfilling than marketing?  “All of it,” she replied. “In the emergency room you learn something new every day. You never feel stagnant. You ask, ‘What can I do?’ and there is always something to improve on, something to learn. The fun part of medicine is you’re never done learning what you can do better.  “We are such a family here. If you see somebody struggling, you go over to help them. ‘Give me something to do; what do you need?’ I never feel alone at my job.”  And COVID-19? Another chance for nurses to step up and shine.  “Even with everything going on personally, after all this started, I never called in [to take time off]. I felt I owed it to my work family to be here and help them.”  Five years into the profession, Latona has found her home.  “Something about nursing just called to me, and I’ve been very happy in that decision,” she said. “I don’t see myself doing anything else ever. You’re always learning something.”  Like Marines, like firefighters, there’s an annealed-in-flame quality to nursing. They’ve gone through the worst, together, which makes them strong, as a group and as individuals.  “It’s all pretty true,” she said. “We’re a tough group of people. We love our job. We see the worst of the worst. The ER is hard because we see somebody’s worst day, every day. We go from somebody passed away in that room, the worst day of that life, and we go in the next room, and that person is having the worst day of their life. That’s why our job is hard. It gets hard.”  Hard, though the job is not without benefits. The praise can be a little embarrassing. But the food is appreciated.  “We’re been very spoiled, lunch provided for us, really frequently,” she said. “We don’t think of ourselves as heroes. We’re just showing up doing our job. That said, we’re not going to say no to a nice lunch.”",1
"14 Hours And A Costco Card: How A Grocer In Alaska Feeds His Town In A Pandemic  Enlarge this image toggle caption Steve Proehl/Getty Images Steve Proehl/Getty Images  Updated at 10:05 a.m. ET on Friday  Think your grocery store runs are tough these days?  In the remote Alaskan city of Gustavus, a small-business owner, Toshua Parker, has started traveling 14 hours by boat to Juneau and back to stock up on critical supplies for his store during the coronavirus pandemic.  The roughly 450 residents in Gustavus rely on Parker's Icy Strait Wholesale for the bulk of their provisions, from fresh produce to hardware to home appliances.  Among locals, Icy Strait Wholesale is better known as ""ToshCo,"" a play on the name of the store's owner and Costco, where the Gustavus business originally sourced most of its items.  In normal times, Parker would rely on Alaska's ferry system to deliver goods. Gustavus, a peninsular region surrounded by Glacier Bay National Park, is only accessible by airplane or boat. But ferry services have stalled — partly because of stoppages related to the coronavirus.  So, the owner found a workaround.  Parker and a crew of staff have been hauling supplies via ship from Juneau, 50 miles away, scheduling each trip around the tides. When Parker finds empty shelves at the local Costco, he gets orders shipped from out of state.  ""It's like Christmas when the load gets here,"" Parker told The Hustle. ""Everyone is waiting for it. Word gets out, and they all seem to know when it's coming.""  He credits his 15 employees with helping to keep the store running.  ""They're coming to work every day, no matter what, during this pandemic to make sure the town has groceries,"" he said in an interview with NPR's Morning Edition.  The store has been keeping anxious locals updated on its Facebook page, uploading photos to share the status of the Gustavus-bound ship or a new restock.  ""No reason for panic buying,"" reads one post accompanying a photo of a bulk supply of toilet paper. ""Our supply chain may be occasionally delayed but it's holding. We've got you covered Gustavus!""  In the comments, grateful customers express their thanks.  ""We are fortunate to have such dedicated people keeping us fed and supplied,"" wrote one commenter. ""Stoked for flour!!!!"" wrote another.  As the country faces meat shortages triggered by plant shutdowns and outbreaks amid suppliers, the general store is looking ahead.

"(Reuters) - The following is a brief roundup of the latest scientific studies on the novel coronavirus and efforts to find treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus. Normal speech sprays droplets with contagious coronavirus The thousands of tiny fluid droplets that we spray during normal conversation are a potentially significant way the new coronavirus spreads from person to person, according to a report on Wednesday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA. Using laser light scattering, researchers studied the small droplets that linger in the air after exiting the mouth. Based on earlier research into levels of the virus in oral fluid, they estimate that one minute of loud speaking could generate more than 1,000 virus-containing droplets that would remain airborne for at least eight minutes. ""There is a substantial probability that normal speaking causes airborne virus transmission in confined environments,"" Philip Anfinrud and Adriaan Bax of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland and their coauthors conclude. (https://bit.ly/3fJIRqp) Twin antibodies may be better than one Scientists have found twin antibodies that neutralize the new coronavirus, each by slightly different mechanisms. Finding a way to use both antibodies simultaneously might be a particularly good way to attack the virus, the researchers say. According to their report on Wednesday in Science, the two antibodies were isolated from a patient who recovered from COVID-19. Both work by attaching to a spike on the virus that helps it break into human cells. Because the antibodies each bind to different places on the spike, a ""cocktail"" containing both may be more effective than a treatment using either one by itself. The information could also help in development of a preventive vaccine, the laboratory experiments suggest. Furthermore, even if the virus mutates so that one of the antibodies no longer works, the other might still retain its neutralizing activity. (https://bit.ly/2WsbD7b) Children with cancer may be no more vulnerable to the coronavirus than healthy kidsChildren with cancer do not need to delay treatment for fear of becoming more vulnerable to the new coronavirus, according to a study reported on Wednesday in JAMA Oncology. ""It was reassuring that they didn't appear to be any more vulnerable than other children,"" Dr. Andrew Kung, coauthor of the study and head of pediatrics at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, told Reuters. ""With this information we can now feel confident to forge ahead with cancer therapy and not delay out of fears of affecting susceptibility to COVID-19."" Among children with cancer but without symptoms of coronavirus infection, only 2.5% tested positive for the virus, researchers reported. Among those who had been exposed to the virus or had symptoms suggestive of infection, 29.3% tested positive, with only one requiring hospitalization. Altogether, the team tested 178 children and 74 adult caregivers for the virus. Among the children's asymptomatic caregivers, 14.7% turned out to be infected. ""Even in that setting, we found that just half of the time when a caregiver was positive did the kid also test positive,"" Kung said. ""This suggests that there is something about kids that makes them less susceptible not just to the development of symptoms but to the infection itself."" (https://bit.ly/3cuDM3j)Scientists find cheaper way to study coronavirus genomeResearchers have found a simpler, cheaper way to sequence the coronavirus genome, a crucial process that allows researchers access the genetic information in the RNA of the virus. ""This approach builds on ongoing sequencing efforts by other groups but bypasses time consuming and costly steps in preparing samples for sequencing,"" Daryl Gohl of the University of Minnesota Genomics Center, who led the research, told Reuters. ""The ability to sequence SARS-CoV-2 at low cost and at large scale will aid in the genomic surveillance of (the virus) for public health efforts, and has the potential to accelerate studies on the influence of viral genetics on transmissibility, virulence, and clinical outcomes."" The paper describing the new method was posted online on Tuesday on the bioRxiv website but has not yet been peer-reviewed. (https://bit.ly/3buhU6A) Coronavirus particles in feces may not be infectiousThe new coronavirus may not spread via contact with fecal matter, researchers suggest in a report on Wednesday in Science Immunology. In laboratory experiments, they discovered that while the virus does infect the cells of the small intestine, fluid from the large intestine inactivates it, so that the virus is no longer infectious by the time it is excreted in feces. The authors caution, however, that because they only studied fecal samples from 10 patients, they cannot definitively rule out fecal-oral transmission of COVID-19. Their findings also suggest that certain protein-digesting enzymes help the new coronavirus enter cells in the gut. Blocking those two enzymes might be a way to treat the infection, they speculate, especially since a drug that inhibits the TMPRSS2 enzyme is already approved in Japan to treat pancreatitis.

"TODAY’s Savannah Guthrie spoke exclusively to Melinda Gates, who is working to address the pandemic through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.  She says there are “a few good candidates” for a vaccine and that the U.S. needs “to start looking at a paid medical leave policy” to help workers on the front lines.  She also criticizes the Trump administration for its response to the crisis:  “We haven’t had leadership at the national level … it’s chaos.”  This while wearing a very odd looking upside-down inverted cross around her neck.  Melinda Gates in an interview on TODAY Show pushing hard for a global COVID-19 vaccine was wearing a bright and shiny upside-down cross around her neck.  Symbolism is very important to groups like the Illuminati, the New World Order and others, as they love to flash you signs of how much smarter they are than you and I are.  We are ruled by a satanic death cult who is obsessed with symbolism. Besides Melinda Gates’ inverted cross, here’s 2 more examples of satanic symbolism related to the ‘Gates of Hell’ family and the upcoming ‘mark of the beast’ vaccine:  1.

Take a quick trip to our Predictive Programming section, and you will see immediately what we’re talking about.  All this brings us to an interview the TODAY Show did with Melinda Gates back on November 8th, where we see Melinda wearing an upside-down, or inverted, cross around her neck.  Who likes to wear inverted crosses? Satanists, pagans, witches, warlocks, New Agers, most people in Hollywood … you get the idea.  “Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:” Galatians 3:13 (KJB)  The early First Century Christians never used the cross as a sign or symbol for anything, why? Because it was the instrument of the torturous death of Jesus of Nazareth.  The cross as iconic symbolism would not appear until biblical Christianity was hijacked by the Romans around 325 AD. From that point on you see crosses on everything as Rome infused paganism with Christianity.  The bible tells us that the cross is the sign of a curse, and cursed people hang on them. No one in their right minds who believed the bible would want the sign of a curse hanging around their own necks, much less wearing an upside-down cross like the pagans / satanists do.  I will let you make up your own mind as to why Melinda Gates chose to wear an upside-down cross on national television.  I know she went to Catholic school, and that she and Bill have raised their children as Catholics.  But when you look at the millions of dollars they give to Planned Parenthood, an organization that exists to slaughter children in the womb, exactly what kind of Catholic she is gets a little murky, to say the least.  The Roman Catholic Church, what I like to call counterfeit Christianity, loves weird occult and pagan symbolism.  Over the years we’ve shown you the Vatican Audience Hall that is shaped exactly like a giant snake, and has the freakiest, most nastiest-looking statue right behind here the pope sits. [It’s also worth mentioning that the pope’s throne has a massive inverted cross on it.]  Occult symbolism pervades the Vatican to a very high degree. Melinda Gates is a Catholic, you do the math.

"Germany's RWE said Thursday it had got off to a ""good start"" in 2020 despite the coronavirus pandemic.  Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization came in at 1.3 billion euros ($1.41 billion) in the first quarter, a 19% increase from the same period last year, with the firm also confirming its earnings forecast for 2020.  ""On our side the power generation business has very limited impact from the corona situation,"" Markus Krebber, RWE's chief financial officer, told CNBC on Thursday.  ""Of course, we see muted power demand but usually our positions are hedged very well in advance and that is why we have seen, so far, very limited impact.""  Krebber went on to explain that the situation around the coronavirus was ""more challenging on the operational side.""  ""We have to ensure security of supply, so the health and safety of our workforce is of top priority and we have taken very early pre-emptive measures to ensure that our people stay safe and that we are able, in all conditions, to provide power,"" he said.  RWE carried out a significant asset swap with E.ON last year in a deal valued at more than 40 billion euros. At the time, RWE explained that, going forward, its focus would primarily be on electricity generation ""based on renewables.""  On Thursday, the company noted it was planning to make net investments of around 5 billion euros to expand its renewables portfolio to more than 13 gigawatts by 2022. Krebber told CNBC that the ""shift in business model"" had made RWE's overall business mix ""much more robust.""  ""On the conventional side, as I said, we are hedged long in advance but on the renewables side most of our income is actually locked into government contracts or long term PPAs (power purchase agreement) with industrial customers.",1
"Todd Ahlsten of Parnassus Investments has run one of the best-performing mutual funds of the last 20 years, succeeding through multiple crises and recessions.  He credits those triumphs to an approach based on critical businesses and technologies, as well as innovation and the avoidance of highly levered companies. Along the way he's made some prescient market calls.  Ahlsten told Business Insider about three big purchases and three sales he made during the downturn as he reacted to the crash and prepared for a recovery.  Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.  If you were picking a fund manager to rebuild your portfolio after it was demolished by the coronavirus, Todd Ahlsten would have a strong resume to show you.  Ahlsten took cover as manager of the Parnassus Core Equity Fund in April 2001, after the dot-com bubble burst and as a recession began. By underweighting tech stocks and avoiding companies with questionable business models that weren't likely to bounce back, he crushed the market in 2001 and 2002.  Just a few years later, in 2005, he concluded that a bubble was forming in the housing market and sold the fund's investments in the sector. That helped him position himself defensively for the market's steep downturn a few years later, and he beat the market from 2007-09 as well.  And when the coronavirus crash hit, his strategy still worked.  ""The playbook of avoiding leverage, avoiding low quality companies, investing in companies with longterm sustainable demand and innovation drove performance,"" he told Business Insider. Kiplinger says the fund's annual return of 8.7% over the 20-year span that ended March 31 is surpassed by only five others.  A major component of his approach involves buying companies that look like they're going to be ""relevant"" for years and years and will improve when downturns end. In an exclusive interview, Ahlsten explained how he's applied that strategy to a radically altered market, giving details on three major buys and three sales.  The new additions  Ahlsten quickly made Amazon one of his biggest positions when the market was near its recent lows. Before that, he'd had concerns about both the stock price and Amazon's approach to renewable energy and to worker pay.  ""We looked at the growth of Amazon Web Services, and they're really going to emerge in a very dominant way,"" he said. ""We do take ESG factors into account and we were looking for some improvement on how they think about the environment and workplace.""  Ahlsten says he paid around $1,700 for the stock, so it's already returned 38.5% and was the biggest contributor to the fund's performance in the first quarter. But he's not eyeing the exits.  ""We think it's going to have a very long, dominant future,"" he said.  Also joining the ranks was Adobe, a popular tech stock that had suffered a sharp crash.  ""I think we bought it at 26 times earnings. That was a five-year low on the multiple,"" he said. ""We really found opportunity to buy this company that generates phenomenal free cash flow, over 40% operating margins that can expand. ... We really think they're in a great position.""  That's worked out so far, as the stock has rallied 25% from its mid-March low.  Lastly, Ahlsten doubled the fund's stake in Alphabet, which nosedived about 30% as investors wondered if its advertising revenue was going to crater. Having owned the stock since early 2007, he was comfortable betting on a comeback.  ""We think search and their assets will be even more important,"" he said. ""They can invest in autonomous driving. While some people are pulling back, Google will continue to invest.""  Alphabet stock is up more than 15% in the current quarter, which almost doubles the gain made by the S&P 500.  Ahlsten also parted with the fund's two worst performers during the quarter because their businesses have been upended by the pandemic and recovery looks far away. One of those was Sysco, a food distributor that represented 3% of his portfolio at the end of 2019. Its value is down about 45% since mid-December.  ""I owned that stock for 15 years, but things have changed,"" he said, citing the large number of restaurants that are likely to go out of business and the possibility that people won't be as interested in dining out.  Much the same holds for his former 1% position in Starbucks, which he sold, and his investment in Disney, which Ahlsten cut to about 1% of the fund from 3.8%.  ""Disney Plus is doing well, but the parks could be a long road (to recovery),"" he said .""The movie studios have a longer road to get content out. And then clearly with sports and ESPN (there are) some headwinds there.",1
"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump expressed no concerns Friday about a rapid coronavirus test from Abbott Laboratories that the White House has been relying on to ensure his safety, despite new data suggesting the test may return an inordinate share of false negatives.  Trump expressed his confidence in the test from the north suburban drug manufacturer after a preliminary study by New York University researchers reported problems with it. Trump and his deputies have have promoting the 15-minute test as a “game changer.”  The Food and Drug Administration said late Thursday it was investigating preliminary data suggesting the Abbott test can miss COVID-19 cases, falsely clearing infected patients.  “Abbott is a great test; it’s a very quick test,” Trump said at a Rose Garden event to highlight his administration’s efforts to develop a vaccine for the virus. “And it can always be very rapidly double checked.”  The test is used daily at the White House to test Trump, key members of his staff as well as any visitor to the White House complex who comes in close proximity to the president or Vice President Mike Pence.  “We’ve got to get to the bottom of it, but we still have confidence in the test or we wouldn’t have it on the market,” Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told Fox Business Network.  White House officials on Friday continued using the Abbot ID Now test. Reporters at the White House underwent the test before Trump’s Rose Garden event. The president noted that the administration officials and staff around him, not all of whom were wearing masks, also had undergone testing Friday.  Trump, who also did not wear a mask, was asked why not everyone was wearing a face covering.  “I’ve been tested, we’ve all been tested and we’re quite a distance away, and we’re outdoors,” said Trump. “I told them I gave them the option they can wear it or not.”  Azar described the FDA warning as a routine announcement that comes after medical manufacturers submit any type of negative information about their product.  Trump has praised the Abbott test as “very quick, very good” and alluded to the tests helping keep him safe.  FDA commissioner Steve Hahn said that if a person is suspected of having the disease caused by the coronavirus, “it might be worth, if the test is negative, getting a second confirmatory test. That’s what our guidance is about.”  Hahn, asked on CBS on Friday whether he’d continue to recommend using the test at the White House, said, “That will be a White House decision.” But he said the test is on the market and the FDA continues to “recommend its use or to have it available for use.”  Federal health officials have been alerting doctors to the potential inaccuracy in the test, which is used at thousands of hospitals, clinics and testing sites across the United States.  The FDA warning came a day after New York University researchers reported results suggesting Abbott’s test can miss up to half the infections caught by a rival test made by Cepheid. The research has not been peer-reviewed or published in a medical journal and was based on about 100 patients.  The researchers found that Abbott’s test, run on the company’s portable ID NOW system, missed one-third of the infections caught by Cepheid’s test when swabs were stored in liquid used to transport laboratory samples. When the samples were kept dry the test missed 48% of the cases flagged by Cepheid’s test.  The researchers called the test’s performance “unacceptable,” due to the risk of falsely clearing patients who could spread the infection to others. They acknowledged shortcomings of the study, including the time needed to transport patient samples to the device for processing.  Abbott rejected the findings, saying the researchers used the test “in ways that it was not designed to be used.”  “ID NOW is intended to be used near the patient with a direct swab test method,” the company said in a statement.  The company pointed to other independent study results that found the test accurately detected 90% or more infections.  Last month Abbott changed the instructions for its test to explicitly warn against putting patient samples in transport chemicals. The update came after researchers at the Cleveland Clinic reported a 15% false negative rate for samples stored in the chemicals.  The FDA said it was reviewing the data with Abbott and was working on a letter to health care providers about potential accuracy issues. The agency said physicians may need to confirm the results of a negative Abbott test if patients have symptoms of the virus. Regulators said they are requiring Abbott to conduct follow-up studies on the test’s accuracy.  Federal contracting data show the White House spent $140,666 on the Abbott rapid test kits in April. The Department of Heath and Human Services also paid more than $27.3 million last month for the problematic Abbott tests",1
"The French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi scrapped a plan to give the US priority access to a COVID-19 vaccine it's developing after a backlash from France and the European Union.  CEO Paul Hudson previously said the US ""has the right"" to get the vaccine first should the drug prove effective because the country had contributed the most to Sanofi's vaccine project.  These remarks were criticized by French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe and President Emmanuel Macron, who said no country should have priority over the drug.  On Friday, Serge Weinberg, the chairman of Sanofi's board of directors, intervened, promising no country would get priority.  Sanofi has long received funding from the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority. In February, BARDA sent an extra $30 million to fund Sanofi's vaccine program.

The French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi has reneged on its pledge to give the US priority access to a coronavirus vaccine it's developing after a backlash from the highest levels of French government.  CEO Paul Hudson had said on Wednesday that because the US had spent millions of dollars to support Sanofi's work on a vaccine, it ""has the right to the largest preorder."" Sanofi is developing two vaccines, neither of which has been approved for use yet.  Hudson's logic was met with outrage in France and across the European Union.  A vaccine is ""a global public good, which is not submitted to market forces,"" the office of President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday.  Prime Minister Edouard Philippe echoed those sentiments, tweeting: ""Equal access for all to vaccine is not negotiable.""  For Philippe, it was also a matter of loyalty to France. ""I just reminded Serge Weinberg who chairs Sanofi that this is a great deeply French company,"" he also said.  The French drugmaker Sanofi's headquarters seen in Paris in 2019.

Ian Langsdon, Pool via AP  On February 18, Sanofi announced a new partnership with BARDA, with a new $30 million cash injection to help the search for a vaccine. At the time, Sanofi had already been working on a vaccine by leveraging its research on SARS, another respiratory disease.  Hudson told Bloomberg earlier this week that because the US was first to fund Sanofi's research, it expected ""that if we've helped you manufacture the doses at risk, we expect to get the doses first.""  As a result of the collaboration with BARDA, Hudson said the US could ""expect to get the doses first"" in return for its support.  Critics of the arrangement have pointed out that Sanofi benefits from tax credits from the French state.  The French Socialist Party estimates the French government has saved Sanofi at least 150 million euros, or $162 million, in recent years, the BBC reported.

""Governments and international partners must unite around a global guarantee which ensures that, when a safe and effective vaccine is developed, it is produced rapidly at scale and made available for all people, in all countries, free of charge,"" the letter said.  Stefan de Keersmaecker, a spokesman for the European Commission, told Agence France-Presse: ""The vaccine against COVID-19 should be a global public good and its access needs to be equitable and universal.""  A Sanofi representative told Business Insider's Bryan Pietsch on Wednesday that the company was committed to making its vaccine ""accessible to everyone"" should it prove effective.  The person said partnering with BARDA allowed the company ""to initiate production as early as possible while we continue to develop and register the vaccine.""  Vaccines would be distributed in areas where they are produced, the person added.  Macron on Thursday said he expected a vaccine to be ready no earlier than winter 2021.",1

Since Bright said his concerns were ignored by officials including Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, Azar has stayed by the president's side, and even joined him Thursday to criticize his former employee.

"Family of Amazon employee who died of COVID-19: 'We want answers' ""Their workers aren’t just a number,"" the man's niece said.  As Amazon faces increased calls for transparency over how many employees have tested positive for COVID-19, the company confirmed to ABC News on Friday that another warehouse worker in New York has died amid the pandemic.  George Leigh, who worked at a facility in Long Island, died of complications from coronavirus on April 9, his niece Jasmine Leigh told ABC News. She added that George's family was in the middle of planning a surprise party for his upcoming 60th birthday at the end of summer.  ""He was always loving, caring and bright,"" Jasmine Leigh said of her uncle. ""He was really close to his mom and all his siblings. He would call his mom every day.""  ""We just want to get answers from Amazon,"" she added. ""We just want to get his story out there because we don't think that Amazon is doing enough to protect their workers. ... We also want for Amazon to be more aware of their workers. Their workers aren't just a number.""  Amazon did not respond to an ABC News inquiry over how many employees so far have died from COVID-19, but pressure appears to be building on the company as more deaths are reported in the media.  Workers protest against the failure from their employers to provide adequate protections in the workplace of the Amazon delivery hub on National May Day Walkout/Sickout by workers at Amazon, Whole Foods, Innstacart and Shipt amid the Covid-19 pandemic in Hawthorne, Calif., May 1, 2020. Valerie Macon/AFP via Getty Images  ""We are saddened by the loss of an associate who had worked at our site in Bethpage, New York. His family and loved ones are in our thoughts,"" Rachael Lighty, an Amazon spokesperson, told ABC News in a statement.  He was last at work March 28, according to Amazon, which also said it's notified all associates within the building of their colleague's death.  Earlier this week, a coalition of 13 attorneys general led by Maura Healey of Massachusetts sent a letter to Amazon pressing for stronger measures to protect the health and safety of workers amid the pandemic, and requesting information on how many workers have been infected and how many have died.  ""We have requested but not received information on how many of the Companies' workers have been infected with COVID-19, and how many have died from it. Please provide a state-by-state breakdown for each Company with this information,"" the letter stated.  The letter added that the attorneys general were ""dismayed to have heard multiple reports of Amazon warehouses with inadequate PPE and hand sanitizer, inability to practice social distancing, limited opportunity to wash hands, and other deficiencies that put employees at risk.""  Healey's office said in a statement that the state attorneys general are ""alarmed by recent media reports"" that allege ""insufficient data about infections and deaths"" among Amazon workers.  In an interview that aired Sunday with CBS, Amazon's head of operations, Dave Clark, didn't answer when asked how many workers had tested positive for COVID-19.  ""The actual ... total number of cases isn't particularly useful because it's relative to the size of the building and then the overall community infection rate,"" Clark told CBS.  ""We know,"" he added, when pressed for the figure. ""I don't have the number right on me at this moment because it's not a particularly useful number.""  Lighty told ABC News ensuring the health and safety of employees is a ""top concern"" for Amazon, adding that they ""expect to invest approximately $4 billion from April to June on COVID-related initiatives to get products to customers and keep employees safe.""  ""We are going to great lengths to keep the buildings extremely clean and help employees practice important precautions such as social distancing and other measures,"" Lighty said in the statement, adding that Amazon directly alerts, via text message, every person at a site anytime there's a confirmed diagnosis, including information on when that individual was last in the building.  Jasmine Leigh said that she and her family would like to see even more information from Amazon when a worker tests positive for COVID-19, noting that George Leigh came in contact with so many people at work every day and that they don't know how he was exposed to the virus.  ""He trained a lot of people, so who knows how many people he got in contact with?"" Jasmine Leigh said. ""Them not saying anything is not helping anyone.""  Jasmine Leigh said that she wants her uncle to be remembered by ""how many people loved him.""  ""Even with him dying, we've got a lot of people, his coworkers reaching out to us and saying, 'Oh, he was a very funny guy, he would come to work every day with a smile on his face and everybody would be so happy to see him,'"" she said.",1

Eagle-eyed observers noticed it almost right away — Thursday's weekly US jobless claims report stated that Connecticut had 298,680 claims for the week ending May 9.  It stood out for a few reasons. The first is that Connecticut had 36,138 claims in the prior week, meaning that Thursday's number was a whopping 726% increase in just seven days.  The second is that it put Connecticut at the top of the chart — the Thursday number was the highest in the nation, beating out other larger states such as New York, California, and Pennsylvania.

"Here's How Much Congress Has Approved For Coronavirus Relief So Far And What It's For  Loading...  Updated at 6:58 a.m. ET Saturday  Congress has authorized roughly $3 trillion in coronavirus relief in four separate measures over the last two months. These bills attempt to protect the American economy from long-term harm caused by stay-at-home orders and respond to the overall impact of the virus.  On Friday, the House approved a Democrats-only bill to spend another $3 trillion. Republicans have rejected the proposal, known as the HEROES Act, and are calling for a pause on new aid. But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., says the latest legislation is her starting point for any new negotiations.  In several cases, Congress voted on the relief spending with little time to review the proposals and without an official cost estimate from the Congressional Budget Office. But now CBO has released estimates showing that the costs of some programs are expected to outpace early projections — driving up the total cost of the bills.  These long-term expenses will be added on top of recent projections from the CBO that the U.S. deficit would be more than $3.7 trillion in 2020.  The NPR Politics Podcast House Democrats Push For Money For States In New Relief Bill House Democrats Push For Money For States In New Relief Bill Listen · 14:56 14:56  NPR reviewed data and estimates reported by the CBO to break down how Congress allocated money to respond to the pandemic. Those estimates, known as scores, detail how much the agency expects programs will cost and how those measures will impact the debt, deficit and government revenue.  In some cases, Congress approved a fixed amount of money for a program, like the Paycheck Protection Program loans for small businesses.  In other cases, like the expanded unemployment insurance and tax credits for emergency paid family and sick leave, Congress approved the credits and their values but did not put a cap on the expenditures. When that happens, the CBO estimates the number of people and companies that may take advantage of the program. The CBO often provides those estimates in two-year figures, in part because it may take time for businesses and individuals to file claims.  Here's how the coronavirus relief money breaks down.  Loading...  The bulk of the support for individuals was approved in the second and third packages, known as the Families First Coronavirus Response Act and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Stability Act, also known as CARES.  The biggest expenditures on individuals have been on cash relief payments, expansions to unemployment assistance, emergency family and medical leave.  Cash relief payments: $293 billion (estimated)  Many people have already started to receive direct deposits totaling as much as $1,200 under the program known as recovery rebates. Individuals earning less than $75,000 can expect a one-time cash payment of $1,200. Married couples would each receive a check and families would get $500 per child. That means a family of four earning less than $150,000 can expect $3,400.  The checks start to phase down after that and disappear completely for people making more than $99,000 and couples making more than $198,000.  The cash payments are based on most recent tax filings. People who receive Social Security payments, people experiencing homelessness and others who don't typically need to file tax return are still eligible, too.  Expanded unemployment insurance: $268 billion (estimated).  The third piece of legislation included temporary changes to federal unemployment benefits, including a supplemental benefit for all workers and new protections for gig workers.  Under the legislation, states will still pay base unemployment to people who qualify. That amount varies state by state, as does the amount of time people are allowed to claim it. Congress added $600 per week from the federal government on top of whatever base amount a worker receives from the state. That boosted payment will last through the end of July.  For example, if an out-of-work person is receiving the national average of about $340 per week, under the new federal program their take-home pay will be $940.  The legislation also adds 13 weeks of unemployment insurance. People nearing the maximum number of weeks allowed by their state would get an extension. New filers would also be allowed to collect the benefits for the longer period.  The estimated cost also includes a new, temporary Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program through the end of this year to help people who lose work as a direct result of the public health emergency.  The Congressional Budget Office made their predictions based on a model projecting an unemployment rate reaching 14% in the second quarter of this year and remaining at 10% at the end of 2021.  Administration officials have admitted in recent weeks that the rate could continue rise in the immediate term before recovering. The scorekeepers specifically noted that this is just a projection and the numbers could change, which would in turn change the overall cost of the changes to unemployment insurance.  Emergency family and medical leave: $105 billion (estimated).  The second bill congress approved included new tax credits for businesses to support emergency family and medical leave.  Under the bill, certain employers are required to give up to 80 hours of fully paid sick leave if the employee is unable to work because they are in quarantine and/or experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 and seeking medical care. Those employers would also have to approve up to 80 hours of partially paid leave for people caring for someone under the same conditions or to care for a child under 18 whose regular child care facility or school is closed.  The Congressional Budget Office projects that offering employers fully refundable credits against payroll taxes to compensate employees for the leave will cost the government about $105 billion. This cost is unlike a program where the federal government pays for the benefit directly. Instead, the cost is based on the expectation that the Treasury Department will lose revenues as a result of the policies.  Cost reductions for individuals on federal health insurance programs: $8.6 billion (estimated two-year cost)  The second coronavirus relief bill eliminates any cost-sharing for people seeking testing and treatment for COVID-19 under Medicare, Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP. This was intended to make it easier for low-income people to get tested.  Loading...  The total amount available to big businesses is well over $500 billion. The CARES Act includes a section described as Economic Stabilization and Assistance to Severely Distressed Sectors of the U.S. Economy. That is the long way of describing aid for big businesses. This includes emergency lending from the federal reserve, credit assistance to airlines and pandemic relief for airline workers.  Extra lending authority for the Federal Reserve: $454 billion (this money is expected to be fully recouped with fees and repayments)  This portion of the bill has a big price tag up front, but the CBO estimates that the repayment, fees and other economic activity will make up for the initial spending. They do not consider it a true cost to the federal budget or the deficit. The chart includes the money because it is an approved expenditure, but it is considered in a separate category than the remaining spending. The Federal Reserve has also taken separate actions that don't involve Congress.  Airlines: $58 billion  This money is allocated to help airlines stay open. One portion of that money is set aside to help cover employee wages, salaries and benefits divided up as up to $25 billion for passenger air carriers, up to $4 billion for cargo air carriers, and up to $3 billion for airline contractors.  Loading...  There is more than $800 billion in small business aid spread across the four bills that have passed so far. The biggest portion of that sum is dedicated to the forgivable loans in the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). The first round of PPP — $349 billion — ran out in less than two weeks. Congress approved another $321 billion that is still being spent.  Small businesses also have access to $21 billion in disaster grants plus some additional loan subsidies. There's also a tax credit for keeping employees on payroll that is estimated to cost about $52 billion.  Loading...  Some elements of the CARES act support a wide range of businesses without the size limitations included in the PPP. The legislation establishes a fully refundable tax credit for businesses of all sizes that are closed or distressed to help them keep workers on the payroll. The credit is expected to cost about $52 billion.  The goal is to help businesses re-hire employees that have already been laid off or furloughed. The credit covers to 50% of payroll on the first $10,000 of compensation, including health benefits, for each employee.  For employers with more than 100 full-time employees, the credit is for wages paid to employees when they are not providing services because of the coronavirus. Eligible employers with 100 or fewer full-time employees could use the deduction even if they aren't closed.  Other broader business supports include a delay in when payroll taxes are due, which the CBO estimates will cost $352 billion up front but will be largely repaid years in the future. There are also tax changes increasing the cap on net operating losses and changing the rules for interest deductibility.  Loading...  All four bills include money to help support hospitals and public health systems. The most expensive items include funding for research and development, direct aid to hospitals and care centers, and money to offset more of the cost of treating Medicare patients.  The first bill focused primarily on public health and global health. It was passed in the weeks before it was clear how deeply the coronavirus would affect the U.S. It included $3.1 billion for vaccine and treatment research, $3.2 billion for Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and $1.2 billion for the State Department to carry out global health programs.  The CARES Act provided $1.32 billion for community health centers that provide health care for roughly 28 million people.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention got another $4.3 billion from CARES and the Strategic National Stockpile received $16 billion.  Loading...  Congress has set aside roughly $28 billion to help pay for testing and access to testing. Other spending areas, including funding for the CDC, Food and Drug Administration, and National Institutes of Health have been used to boost testing capacity and speed up the process of approvals.  Loading...  States and local governments have access to funds in a number of programs, particularly public health funding and money for publicly run hospitals and community health centers.  The Families First Coronavirus Response bill included $1 billion for state and local administrative costs, and CARES included $150 billion in direct aid to states for the coronavirus response.  Loading...  There is long list of miscellaneous programs including those that shore up social safety net programs but do not pay money directly to individuals. In many cases, the funding helps support existing federal programs that have been stretched during the coronavirus response.  Child nutrition: There is $8.8 billion in the CARES Act to give schools more flexibility to provide meals for students.  Food stamps: CARES also included $15.5 billion for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP. The money will help cover the expected cost of new applications to the program as a result of the coronavirus. That bill also included $450 million more for food banks and other community food distribution programs.  Government administration: CARES included $10 billion in lending for the Postal Service, the Families First Coronavirus bill gave the IRS $15 million to implement programs – the filing date was extended to July 15.",1
"COVID-19 is now in 100 of Illinois’ 102 counties, as Friday marked the fourth day in a row the state has seen more than 100 lives lost — and the 18th such day since the pandemic began.  With the latest 130 deaths, the state’s toll so far in May alone is 1,727 people, and 4,058 overall.  There were also 2,432 more people who tested positive among the latest batch of 26,565 test results, officials said. And Edgar County became the 100th county to record positive cases in the state.  There have been 90,369 confirmed coronavirus cases since the pandemic began.  The state’s overall positivity rate — the number of positive cases compared to total tests received within the last 24 hours — was 9.1%. And the Northeast region, home to Chicago, Cook and the collar counties, remained under 20%, a required benchmark to enter the next phase of Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s regional reopening plan.  But the positivity rate is a seven-day rolling average and the data lags, Pritzker’s office has said. Each of the state’s four regions must be under that rate for 14 days to advance to the third reopening phase, which allows some “non-essential” businesses to resume limited operations.  Graph not displaying properly? Click here.  The current seven day average of the positivity rate is 12%, Pritzker said, down from an April peak of 23.6%. But the governor warned that part of the reason the positivity rate is lower is because of increased testing.  “Remember, we surpassed 10,000 tests per day for the first time on April 24, and we’ve stayed above 11,000 every day since then. Over the last seven days, we’ve nearly doubled that, with an average of 20,000 tests per day,” Pritzker said. “The good news is that our current statewide positivity rate is under 14% on average for the last 14 days. And that’s likely becoming a better indicator of the true infection rate among the general public than it was when testing was far more limited.”  Pritzker also announced six new testing sites in Chicago, in Little Village, Pullman, Hanson Park, Englewood, Gage Park and Bridgeport.  The state is also launching four new drive-thru sites. Starting Saturday, a drive-thru site in Chatham will begin testing, as well as sites in Champaign, Peoria and Rolling Meadows.  All testing is free, and the sites will be open seven days a week.  Dr. Ngozi Ezike, the head of the Illinois Dept. of Public Health, said as of Thursday night, there were 4,367 people in the state’s hospitals with COVID-19. Of those, about a quarter of them — 1,129 — were in intensive care units, and 675 were on ventilators.  Hospital metrics are also key to Pritzker’s reopening plan. To get to Phase 3, regions must show no overall increase in hospital admissions for COVID-19 symptoms for 28 days, and have at least 14% of ICU beds, medical and surgery beds and ventilators available.  Ezike also issued recommendations for expectant mothers, warning they must be tested for the coronavirus before they’re admitted for delivery.  “First of all, many of the symptoms associated with labor can mimic or cover up symptoms of COVID-19, so we could easily escape detection with just symptom screening,” Ezike said. “But we also know that many people with COVID-19 are completely asymptomatic.  Ezike said early data from hospitals show a positivity rate of between 3% and 12% fo expectant mothers admitted for labor. She said women may be at further risk of additional complications if they have COVID-19.",1
"Seven more employees of Cook County’s Juvenile Temporary Detention Center have tested positive for COVID-19, officials said Friday.  There are now six detainees and 17 employees at the facility that have contracted the coronavirus, according to the Circuit Court of Cook County’s Office of the Chief Judge spokesman Pat Milhizer.  Six of the employees tested positive after receiving on-site tests that began last week for all employees at the detention center, Milhizer said. No one showed symptoms when they were tested.  All six detainees who tested positive were not admitted to the facility’s general population by the time they tested positive, Milhizer said. So far, there are no confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the general population.  The Circuit Court of Cook County now has 32 employees who have tested positive for the coronavirus, he said. Other employees who have tested positive for COVID-19 worked at the Leighton Criminal Courthouse and the Daley Center.",1
"The Food and Drug Administration is ""digging into"" data that says a popular coronavirus test may give inaccurate results, Commissioner Stephen Hahn said. However, Hahn said the agency recommends that the Abbott Laboratory test, which is used to test President Donald Trump and White House staffers, still be available for use.  The FDA issued an emergency authorization in March for the Abbott ID NOW point-of-care test, which delivers results in minutes. The FDA published a warning about it on Thursday after an NYU Langone Health study, which has not been peer-reviewed, found that it might return false negatives — meaning it might say a person doesn't have the virus when they actually do.  ""What we're saying is that there are some data to suggest that there may be inaccuracies, false negatives, with the Abbott test. However, there are many users who have contacted us and have not had this problem, so FDA is digging into it, and we're working with Abbott to actually look at what data are available to get the most up to date and accurate information about the test performance,"" Hahn said on ""CBS This Morning"" Friday. ""That being said, the test is on the market. We continue to recommend its use or to have it available for use.""  Hahn also noted that point-of-care tests in general ""would have a lower sensitivity than a test that's based in the laboratory.""  ""We've known that for years,"" he said, but added that the data the FDA used to grant the emergency use authorization for the Abbott test ""were very robust.""  The purpose of the new FDA warning was to make sure providers have the information about what the test does.  ""So for example, if a person you suspect — a doctor suspects a person has the disease, it might be worth, if the test is negative, getting a second confirmatory test. That's what our guidance is about,"" he said.  Hahn said the FDA is providing guidance to the White House about the test, but said it is up to them if they choose to keep using it. Mr. Trump has praised the test as ""ultra-fast"" and ""very accurate.""  Abbott said while some studies have shown the ""sensitivity performance percentages,"" or true positive rates, of the test to be in the 80s, others have shown it at or above 90%, and one showed it as high as 94%.  ""We're seeing studies being conducted to understand the role of ID NOW in ways that it was not designed to be used. In particular, the NYU study results are not consistent with other studies,"" the statement said. ""While we understand no test is perfect, test outcomes depend on a number of factors including patient selection, specimen type, collection, handling, storage, transport and conformity to the way the test was designed to be run. ID NOW is intended to be used near the patient with a direct swab test method.""  The company also said it will clarify its guidelines and continue ""to optimize"" the test.  Hahn also was asked about the testing capacity in the United States.  ""We continue to work with close to 300 test developers. We have not taken our foot off the pedal with respect to this,"" he said. ""We recognize the need to get more tests on the market, and we're working with developers to do that.""  He said there are a number of factors contributing to delays in more tests, including the need for data before authorizing a test and an ""unprecedented demand for the tests.""  Hahn would not say if putting the onus on states to run testing and contact tracing was the best approach, but said, ""there are unique circumstances in the states.""  ""The governors understand what best happens in the states, and we will provide them as much support as we possibly can to make the absolute best public health decisions,"" he said.",1
"When California issued a stay-at-home order back in March to curb the spread of the coronavirus, Dana Angelo, a 33-year-old copywriter at an ad agency in Los Angeles, found herself with more free time. So, out of boredom, she turned to a social activity she could still do from home: She got back on the dating app, Bumble.  Angelo said she’s been rotating through online dating apps — she’s also tried Tinder and Hinge — with minimal luck since getting out of a long-term relationship about a year ago, and had recently been taking a break. “You just see the same people on all of them and then it gets kind of depressing,” Angelo said.  But something surprising happened this time around: She actually met someone she genuinely likes. With the possibility of sex — or any physicial intimacy — off the table for now due to social distancing, she said it was easier to sort out matches who were just “cycling through people” from those who were actually looking for a relationship.  After texting for a few days, she organized a virtual date via FaceTime with the match she liked, chatting over drinks for about two hours. The third time, their FaceTime date was over brunch, for about four hours. Eventually, they took the step of meeting in person with a walk in his neighborhood — albeit keeping a 6-foot distance, with her dog in between them.  In the midst of the deadly coronavirus outbreak, a frightening global event that has negatively affected people’s lives in many ways, including causing intense loneliness and isolation for some, Angelo found a rare bright spot. It has actually improved her dating life.  “I’m not used to someone making this much effort,” she said.  “It’s an excellent time for singles to date,” said Helen Fisher, the chief scientific adviser to Match.com and a senior research fellow at The Kinsey Institute. “People have time. They’re not getting dressed up to go to work. And most importantly, they have something to talk about.”  Not everyone, though, is keen to get into online dating, even if spending more time than usual alone at home has made some otherwise happily single people reconsider their feelings about finding a long-term companion. Not to mention that the pandemic has ushered in mass unemployment, higher levels of stress, greater strain for single parents and worries about fatal risks from stepping outside your door — factors not necessarily conducive to romance. While some have sought solace on dating apps, others are looking to online communities to connect with those who are also having a hard time, or focusing on friends and family who were already part of their life before the coronavirus.  Still, some daters looking for a relationship in the time of social isolation are finding opportunity. “Watch the pandemic be the reason why I might get into a meaningful relationship, because we had to take the time to get to know each other,” Angelo said.  Dating goes virtual  The popularity of online dating has grown immensely over the last decade, and is now the most common way that couples in the U.S. meet. A study by Stanford’s School of Humanities and Sciences found that 39 percent of heterosexual couples reported meeting online in 2017, compared with 22 percent in 2009. The number was even higher for same-sex couples that year, 60 percent of whom reported meeting online in 2017.  Fifty years ago, a global pandemic might have hindered single people from connecting with prospects through their family, friends or faith communities. But these days, most people are connecting virtually to start anyway. “The influence of technology on our romantic and sexual lives has been so enormous,” said Justin Garcia, an evolutionary biologist and sex researcher at The Kinsey Institute. “From online dating, to texting, video chatting, sexting, etc., we have already been in the midst of a digital revolution for human courtship,” he added, so it’s not a huge surprise that singles would continue dating this way in the midst of a pandemic.  “Watch the pandemic be the reason why I might get into a meaningful relationship, because we had to take the time to get to know each other.”  The stay-at-home orders issued across the country have been a boon for some of the major online dating apps. “As a city goes into lockdown, engagement on OKCupid goes up,” the app’s global chief marketing officer, Melissa Hobley, said. Since March, the company has seen a whopping 700 percent increase in the amount of OKCupid users going on a virtual date. The app Hornet, which caters to the gay male community, has seen a 30-percent increase in social feed engagement since social distancing measures began in mid-March, according to CEO Christof Wittig. And the dating app Tinder reported that it saw more engagement on March 29 than on any other day in its history, with more than 3 billion users swiping to connect with people, according to an April 1 press release.  Once dating app users have made an initial connection, the way that they are getting to know each other has changed significantly during this period of social distancing. Most bars and restaurants, traditional first date spots, are closed down, and those who elect to meet up with a stranger could risk contracting COVID-19 themselves, or spreading it to others.  As a result, many singles have taken their meetups online, electing to go on virtual dates via Zoom or FaceTime, or through video chat features on the dating apps themselves. Recent surveys conducted by online dating companies indicate that members are more inclined to try this now than ever before.  A study conducted by Match found that while only 6 percent of singles were using a video platform to meet a potential date before the COVID-19 outbreak, 69 percent of singles said they’d be open to chatting over video with someone they met on a dating app during quarantine as of mid-April. Twenty-two percent of these respondents even said they’d consider entering an exclusive relationship with someone they hadn’t met in person, indicating an openness to cultivating relationships mostly online. As of the end of April 23, 51 percent of users on the dating app Coffee Meets Bagel said they planned to video chat more, and 18 percent had had at least one video call with a match.  The outbreak “has sort of turned our social behavior upside down,” Garcia said. He noted that terror management theory — which suggests that people evaluate their environments and social interactions differently when faced with their own mortality — may explain why singles have been more open to trying new things during this period.  This is true for sexual relationships, in some cases. The Kinsey Institute recently conducted a study of a diverse range of adults aged 18-81, and found that while 43.5 percent had seen their sex life decline during the coronavirus pandemic, one in five respondents reported they had tried adding new things to their sexual repertoire, such as sexting, sending nude photos to someone else, or watching pornography. But it’s also true for those pursuing romantic relationships, as these people have had to reconsider what they want, and how best to meet and connect with people under lockdown.  “If we weren’t in lockdown and some guy asked me to do a FaceTime date, I would think that’s strange and weird,” said 35-year-old Nashville resident Maureen Iselin. But now, “I feel like it’s just socially acceptable.” After ending a long-term relationship in the fall, Iselin got back on dating apps. Instead of putting her dating life on hold during the pandemic, she recently agreed to chat over FaceTime with a man she met online.  WATCH:What COVID-19 has meant for dating in America  “It was a whole new way of thinking about dating. Like, do I get dressed up to this? Do I put on makeup? What are we gonna talk about besides the coronavirus and being in quarantine?” Iselin said. She added that going on a FaceTime date took off a little bit of the pressure because they were both in their home environments, and she planned to do one again with the same person.  “It’s a test of how well you actually converse, and you get to know someone in a different way,” said 26-year-old Naakita Feldman-Kiss, who has been conversing via FaceTime and Zoom with women she’s met on the dating app Lex, and has exchanged gifts with some of them. “There’s actually this deeper intimacy that I’ve developed with people, because … it doesn’t really allow for silence in the same way,” Feldman-Kiss said. “I really kind of like the slow burn of getting to know people over phone and video and text,” said Holly Samuelson, a 34-year-old from San Francisco who recently had a date over FaceTime where she and her date sketched drawings of each other (both are artistically inclined — he’s a builder, while she’s a fashion designer). Although the guy she had been talking to online lives 100 miles away, she said that distance seemed less of a deal breaker since California shut down amid the pandemic.  Rachel Ware, a 27-year-old project manager in Atlanta, recently went on a socially distant jog in a park with someone she met through Facebook’s dating feature, and managed to chat with him for a steady 3 miles. She said she actually liked being able to meet up with an online connection in the park because it feels safer and more secure than a bar, for example. “I’m a very private person and I’m very wary about security,” Ware said. “I like parks because they’re a public space, and you can meet someone and not feel the pressure.”  Of course, just because potential suitors are open to video dating doesn’t mean the connection is guaranteed to be strong. “There will still be time wasters who take phone calls for connection but it doesn’t mean when this is all over they’re looking for a relationship,” said Francesca Hogi, a love and life coach based in L.A. who has a number of clients that have recently tried out virtual dating, including Holly Samuelson.  For Justin Becker, a 33-year-old lawyer based in Washington, D.C., the coronavirus has more or less put his dating life on hold. He recently chatted over Google Hangouts with a guy he met in person before the pandemic began, but has not done so with anyone he met on a dating app. Becker said he had a hard time believing that video dates could move a relationship forward, with someone he had never met in person: “I feed off someone else’s energy, and I do not get energy through an app whatsoever.”  Embracing the “slow burn”  Before the novel coronavirus hit, U.S. couples were already getting married later in life than ever before. Helen Fisher said what’s happening now is increasing the amount of time people spend in a “courtship” stage even more.  “We’re seeing the emergence of a new phase in the courtship trajectory, which is meet online, talk online, then talk in person,” Fisher added. “Yes, we’re moving forward to the past. We’re getting to know somebody before the sex.”  But, for some, slowing down has encouraged them to open up about priorities and feelings earlier on than they would have otherwise.  “We’re moving forward to the past. We’re getting to know somebody before the sex.”  Connor Price, a 40-year-old who recently moved from New York to Los Angeles to work for a music nonprofit, found that true when he started seeing a woman right around the time California shut down. The woman, whom he had met through a close friend, didn’t want to put her mother in danger of contracting the virus. So she and Price started taking nightly walks in their neighborhoods, keeping 6 feet distance from one another.  “It also almost felt like dating in the Elizabethan era,” Price said. “If I could get, like, one little finger tip, in between her shoulder blades through a parka, that was like the most exciting thing I’ve had in a month.”  Gradually, the two have started to spend more time together, and even shared their first kiss of the pandemic while making dinner one night. Because their activities have been limited, they’ve had serious conversations early on about what they want out of a relationship.  “We had some very personal conversations much earlier in a relationship I think either one of us would have had because we’re spending actually a lot of time with each other. We kind of cut off the entire rest of the world and it’s just the two of us,” Price said. “Normally, these kind of conversations don’t come out for six months.”  Fisher argues that the coronavirus-related shutdowns have made conditions ripe for romance like the one Price entered at the beginning of March.  “When your daily habits change, it’s novel. And novelty drives up dopamine in the brain,” the biological anthropologist said. “The novelty is setting up the brain, priming the brain for love. It’s a very good time for romance.”  “I truly believe this is how you need to get to know people, anyway,” Price said. “This kind of slowed us both down and made us calculate how and when we wanted to do things. It’s been fun.”  Missing connection  Of course not everyone is looking for the sort of long-term relationship Fisher spoke about, while others who were content being single before the pandemic have had a harder time dealing with being alone as they stay home and miss the normal social interactions of daily life and human touch.  “I think the desire for a romantic relationship is certainly heightened right now,” said Shani Silver, a writer and host of the podcast A Single Serving. “It’s a lot easier to feel lonely, particularly romantically lonely.”  While Silver has shaped her brand around being “an advocate for single women as whole, happy beings,” she recently penned an essay for Refinery29 in which she wrote about the challenges of being alone during the coronavirus pandemic. After experiencing a serious bout of depression, she wrote that she suddenly felt “an instinctual, threatened, terrified loneliness that needed a hug and an apocalypse partner and neither were available. I didn’t know how long I would be alone for, and for the first time in a very long time, I cared.” In other words, it made her think, “I just want a f***ing husband.”  On the Facebook group for Silver’s podcast, women grapple with some of the same feelings that she’s experienced while holed up in her Brooklyn apartment, sharing stories about “quarantine” texts from exes or “one and done dates,” the struggle of being the last single person in their social circle, and getting through nights where they just feel very lonely.  Silver said she’s been irked by the ways that online dating companies have sought to capitalize on the pandemic by encouraging more people to make distance dating a priority at this time.  “What does that say to single people? ‘Don’t worry, we know how awful this is that you’re single. We want to make sure you can tell that even during a global pandemic,’” Silver said, criticizing the tone that some dating apps have taken in recent weeks. “It’s hurtful, honestly.”  Even on apps designed for in-person connection, it’s clear that many are feeling isolated and lonely at this time. On Lex, which caters to LGBTQ women, users post personal ads with headlines such as “Numb,” or “Quarantine Mood,” where they write about “feeling deeply unloveable,” “touch deprived,” or “bored and confined.”  While Silver recognizes that there will undoubtedly be quarantine love stories that arise out of the coronavirus, she’s more concerned about the “thousands and thousands of single people” who won’t meet a significant other during this time. For now, she prefers to focus on “connections we can safely have that are just as meaningful and that don’t involve making us feel like crap in the meantime.”  There are certainly singles who have sought to do this. Twenty-six-year-old Patrick Easley had been talking to a few guys on Hinge and Tinder, but lost the momentum when he moved back home to be with his mother, who is 60. “It’s this weird emotional purgatory, because people do want that interpersonal interaction,” Easley said of dating right now. “You can only date someone that you don’t know online or over the phone for so long.”  For now, Easley’s put off dating to focus on spending time with his mom, with little regret: “Getting to know her as an independent adult is really cool.”  We don’t know how single life and dating culture will be changed by the end of the coronavirus pandemic, but already it has seemed to challenge nearly everyone — single or not — to contemplate their closest relationships, and how they cultivate connection in the midst of a crisis.  Justin Becker said that while he misses physical connections with other men, he’ll be more thoughtful about how he chooses to enter relationships moving forward. “I tend to be a little serial monogamist when it comes to dating, where I want to jump into the next serious thing.” He said that this period of being home more often than usual has made him reflect on to whom he wants to commit.  In the future, he said, he’ll take the time to consider, “are they someone that complements you and brings out the best in you, versus just having someone to have someone?”",1

"This photo taken on February 28, 2020 shows workers producing face masks at a factory in Handan in China's northern Hebei province. STR | AFP via Getty Images  BEIJING — The unemployment rate in China remained near historic highs in April, highlighting the challenges the world's second-largest economy still faces in recovering fully from the economic shock of the coronavirus. China's official, but highly doubted, urban unemployment rate rose to 6.0% in April, from 5.9% in March, according to figures released Friday by the National Bureau of Statistics. ""The pressure on employment is rather large,"" bureau spokeswoman Liu Aihua told reporters at least three times during Friday's press conference. That's according to a CNBC translation of her Mandarin-language remarks.  Although monthly figures for the overall economy show some recovery, challenges remain, such as resuming work and the impact of the virus overseas, Liu said. ""Right now, the trajectory of economic development still requires observation, but ... based on the results of policies for resuming work and production, we have the confidence, ability and basis for extending the momentum of recovery and improvement."" Liu noted that the bureau's survey found that at the end of April, the number of migrant workers who had returned to their jobs in the cities was about 90% of what it was a year ago. In early March, official figures showed the return to work for migrant workers from the poorest households in the country was about half of what it was a year ago. More than half of China extended the Lunar New Year holiday by at least a week in an effort to control the Covid-19 disease, which first emerged late last year in the Chinese city of Wuhan. By early March, the virus outbreak had stalled domestically while accelerating its spread overseas. Covid-19 has now killed more than 302,000 people worldwide, including over 4,600 in China.  Slowing economy to hit more jobs  Similar lockdowns on economic activity in the U.S. sent the unemployment rate soaring to 14.7% in April, the highest since World War II and up from months of historic lows near 4% or less. In February, the peak of the coronavirus outbreak in China, the unemployment rate jumped to a record high of 6.2%. For the 25 to 59-year-old group, the rate has hovered near 5.5% for the last three months. The average work-hours a week per employee also fell in April by 30 minutes to 44.3 hours, the data showed. China's unemployment data have been highly doubted, even after the country changed its methodology from worker claims to a survey in 2018 in an effort to capture more of the job losses. The urban unemployment rate has hovered near 4% to 5% for the last 20 years. ""We think that pressure on employment will continue,"" Bruce Pang, head of macro and strategy research at China Renaissance, said Friday. He pointed to factors such as fewer new jobs due to slower economic growth, sluggish demand for Chinese exports and a record-high number of university graduates this year. The continued struggles of small and medium-sized enterprises, which contribute to the majority of jobs and growth in China, adds further pressure to employment. Pang pointed to third-party business registration data that showed 460,000 companies closed in the first quarter, while the establishment of 3.2 million new Chinese companies during that time still marked a nearly 29% decrease from a year ago.

Nicolas Asfouri/AFP via Getty Images  Slate is making its essential coronavirus coverage free for all readers. Subscribe to support our journalism. Start your free trial.  Usually, when you run a vaccine experiment, there’s tons of red tape. There are ethical boards to consult and subjects to recruit. Then you have to convince people with money that your research is important enough to move forward at all. But now, there’s none of that. A vaccine for the coronavirus is at the top of the priority list, and everyone’s moving as fast as they can.  Dr. Kirsten Lyke is the lead investigator on COVID-19 vaccine trials at the University of Maryland’s Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health. She’s worked on vaccines for years—some have panned out, and some haven’t. She knows trials like this one can take a long time, and she also knows that the vaccine she’s testing may not work at all. But she’s optimistic anyway, and hoping to have a vaccine in just a few short months.  On Thursday’s episode of What Next, I asked Lyke how this is even possible, and spoke with her about the accelerated timeline for the COVID-19 vaccine. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.  Mary Harris: Right now, your vaccines are at the very earliest phase of human testing, called Phase 1.  Kirsten Lyke: A straightforward Phase 1 study is usually 40 to 50 subjects: volunteers who agreed to participate. And it may take anywhere from 12 to 18 months from the time we decide to do a study to ramp it up.  How does that compare with what you’re doing now?  We got a call from Pfizer around April 10 right requesting that we consider participation. We had our first Zoom meeting that Wednesday. It was essentially two weeks of round-the-clock work to get the study up and running, and then last week we put out the call to volunteers asking for recruits.  So are you saying that normally a process that could take a year took four weeks?  A month. That’s exactly what I’m saying.  Can you describe the room where you’re giving the vaccinations? Like, do you have a basement bunker?  It looks like your regular doctor’s office, where we have several individual rooms where we can put one volunteer at a time. But these are really unusual times. So everyone who comes to campus here in Maryland has to wear a mask. We meet them at the door and do a prescreening. We ask them if they’ve been exposed to COVID-19 or if they’ve had COVID 19, go through a list of questions to discern if they have any symptoms of COVID-19, and then do their temperature. Only then are they allowed to get a little golden ticket that allows them to enter the vaccine area.  For vaccination, it’s a process. The very first thing we do before is a nasal-pharyngeal swab, just like everyone around the country is getting. So within 45 minutes, we’ve determined whether they’re shedding the virus, and if they’re negative, we can go ahead and randomize and enter them into the system so that we can get them on the docket for vaccination.  It sounds like you feel like you’re on a clock.  We are on a clock. We’re on a very rapid sprint overlaying a marathon because every single week we have to recruit a number of volunteers to fill our docket for next week’s dose escalation. So we’re vaccinating this particular round while simultaneously recruiting for next week’s round, when we’ll go to the next dose.  How many vaccines a week are you giving?  We’re actually testing four different vaccines at three different dose levels. We’re also doing young people up to age 55. Then we’ll move to older people. Every one of those permutations needs 15 people. This is just, at this stage, a safety and immunity study. We’re looking at immune responses and testing the safety of each of these permutations of the vaccine.  The overarching design of the study is to test people from ages 18 to 85 and ultimately those with all sorts of risk factors for COVID-19: diabetes, hypertension, lung disease. But right now, in these very, very early stages, we’re testing just the 18- to 55-year-olds who are healthy. Come June, we’ll move to the older age group. Come July, we’re going to move to people who have other comorbidity conditions. And as we work our way along the ladder, we’ll cover the full panoply of people who are most at risk and need to have a vaccine.  One of the things that is helping for this particular scenario is that everything is shut down. At our center, it’s called severe restriction: We’re not allowed to do other studies or invite volunteers for any of our other ongoing studies. It’s prioritized as COVID-19 studies only.  So this is all you can work on.  For the most part, everything has been stalled. Anyone who has expertise in what we do is declared essential and allowed to be on campus to continue research. Everyone has been freed up of their day-to-day work to have time to concentrate on just doing this trial.  How do you speed things up without cutting corners? Even if you pour people into something, it still takes a toll to move so fast.  Obviously a COVID-19 vaccine has not been in people and has not really been in a lot of preclinical studies, where they go into different animals and officials do exhaustive testing. Mice have been injected and we have very limited data, but most of the data that was given to the FDA to move forward on this was with companion vaccines that had been made with the same platform but weren’t necessarily COVID-19-based vaccines.  So it’s the same method, but it’s not the same virus.  Right. So that may not fly in ordinary situations. But the FDA has agreed that the preponderance of evidence established that this was safe. We have safety data, but to some degree, it might not be the mountains of data that are typically generated before moving forward.  What kind of people are volunteering for this? I know you pay them, so there’s an incentive, but who’s going up and saying, “I want to be on the front lines of testing a pretty unproven vaccine”?  The good thing is that there are a lot of people at home who wanted to do something. Obviously there are people who need some money. But I would say overwhelmingly it’s not people looking for any compensation. Most tell me they’re going to donate their checks. It’s people from the community. It’s people maybe associated with the university but who aren’t in direct patient care.  Are you even really testing for how effective the vaccine is, or is it mostly just safety? I know that in a Phase 1 trial, you may look for a little bit of effectiveness, but you’re mostly just saying, can we do this?  “I don’t think we want to wait the amount of time it takes for society at large to develop immunity.” — Kirsten Lyke  Right now we’re interested predominantly in safety and also whether the immune response that’s mounted is actually specific to the virus and in a petri dish can neutralize the antibodies. We are collecting data so that if people develop COVID-like symptoms, we’ll have them do a self-swab and send it to us so we can collect all of that data. The length of the trial for people participating right now is actually 26 months, even though we hope we’ll have picked a vaccine and it’s gone into production well before that. You know, as early as this autumn, they’re still going to be participating and coming in for blood draws so we can see how long their antibody response lasts.  Like a lot of things when it comes to this coronavirus, with this vaccine, we are going to be learning a lot on the fly. Even if it’s proved safe and goes into production in the next few months, we might not know exactly how effective it is until after it gets released. There’s an element of taking it on faith. So what does effectiveness look like in a vaccine like this? I get the chickenpox vaccine and I don’t get that condition. Do you think we’re going to be able to promise that a vaccine we’re working on so quickly for a condition we’re really just learning the contours of?  There are so many unknowns that it’s impossible to say. I can say that this is what we hope for: that the vaccine we’re developing today is going to work and it’s going to cover people for a reasonable amount of time. And that is where what is reasonable to me may not be reasonable to someone else. Everyone has experience with the flu vaccine—every year we have to make a new crop of vaccines. The total overall efficacy differs year after year, 70 percent, 50 percent.  Sometimes it’s zero percent efficacy.  Sometimes it’s not effective at all. And that would not be acceptable. I mean, we’re hoping for a high level of protective efficacy in a virus that’s not mutating. That’s a lot to ask. We just don’t know how this is going to all play out. All we know is that there are other coronaviruses circulating, like the common cold—which isn’t a deathly illness. Hopefully this will morph into that. But I don’t think we want to wait the amount of time that it takes for society at large to develop immunity.  In you pre-pandemic work, you focused on diseases like dengue, which is caused by a virus, and malaria, which is caused by a parasite. We’ve been looking for a vaccine for those for years, and we still haven’t found anything, really.  That’s absolutely correct. Half a million people die of malaria a year. And there is no sense of urgency anywhere up and down the levels of vaccine development.  I wonder if it kind of makes you humbled looking at this coronavirus, with folks saying we want a vaccine in 18 months. You know how hard the work is.  Malaria is a different beast. It is very, very difficult to develop a vaccine because it’s so complicated. The beauty of viruses is they’re so simple—they can’t even replicate themselves. HIV is an exception because it morphs and changes genetically. It’s constantly evolving, so it’s hard to keep up. But Ebola, for example, is a simple virus. It can’t mutate that quickly because it typically ended up killing people before it had a chance to mutate. So it was relatively easy to make a vaccine, and we’re kind of hoping the same thing with COVID-19, not to minimize the difficulty.  You sound so confident!  Well, I think we’re going to get it. I mean, there are a hundred companies claiming they have a vaccine that they want to bring to fruition. We just happen to have been part of a process that had the financial means and the infrastructure to get it off the ground very quickly. So I hope this one works, but I also hope other vaccines work because by the time we get to autumn and start ramping up production, I don’t think one company is going to be able to develop worldwide mass production immediately.

The unofficial start of summer is just over a week away!  But unfortunately, summer is canceled. Not to mention, the window to take advantage of cheap gas for your road trip is closing fast.  In Wisconsin — where gas was as low as 87 cents just weeks ago — the bottom is now up to a whopping $1.44. Who can even afford that?  Rising gas prices are just one sign that oil markets are starting to recover, in step with global oil demand. That's great news for an industry that faced one of the worst springs in history.  Now we're starting to ask: What will the energy industry look like when the pandemic is in the rearview?  For starters, we asked a bunch of CEOs.  We had the pleasure of interviewing eight top energy execs — from BP's Susan Dio to Duke Energy's Lynn Good — about how the coronavirus will change their companies and the industry at large.  Theme 1: The transition to low-carbon energy remains at center stage even as majors slash their budgets. 2020 forecasts aside, the pandemic won't do much to slow it down.  Theme 2: People are craving energy resilience, especially as wildfire and hurricane seasons draw near. That could give residential solar and infrastructure projects a boost.  Here are a few of the comments that stood out to me. You can read all of them here.  ""California had one of the driest months of February in its history, and because of COVID-19, we've seen reports of fewer prescribed burns, which increases the risk of wildfires this fall,"" Sunrun's CEO Lynn Jurich said.  ""We have a wire or a pipe connected to businesses in every county of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan,"" CMS Energy's CEO Patti Poppe said. ""The question for us in the midterm is how will those businesses come back.""  ""We are a little bit worried about the electrification of transportation right now because I think the transportation sector is suffering a lot,"" Energy Impact Partners' CEO Hans Kobler said. ""Electric vehicle sales will be down 40%.""  I don't know what I'm eating for lunch or where I'll be living in two months, let alone what the world will look like in 20 years.  But if anyone is up for the task of predicting the future of energy, it's analysts at the research firm Wood Mackenzie. This week, they sketched out three paths that a recovery could take, and what each means for energy.  ""Full recovery"": A coronavirus vaccine becomes available next year, and governments around the world pour money into spurring economic growth.  Oil demand returns to pre-pandemic levels of around 100 million barrels per day (bpd) in the 2020s and then reaches a peak of more than 110 million bpd by the mid-2030s.  Natural gas and cheap renewable energy sources would slowly replace coal, causing it to decline slightly by 2040.  ""Go it alone"": The virus is tough to defeat, trade and travel are restricted, and the world suffers from a long recession.  Global demand for oil increases very little after an initial rebound.  ""By 2030 it is barely any higher than was expected for 2020 if the pandemic had not hit,"" they said.  ""Greener growth"": A short recession is followed by a strong rebound that includes government support for low-carbon energy.  Oil demand wouldn't move much for the next decade or so and then decline steeply in the 2030s.  Most remarkably, ""the combined share of oil, gas, and coal in total primary energy drops to 68% in 2040, down from 84% in 2019,"" the analysts said.  An oil well owned an operated by the company Apache in the Permian Basin near Garden City, Texas Spencer Platt/Getty Images  Oil prices have rallied in recent weeks, but the US shale industry — once synonymous with American energy dominance — is not exactly celebrating.  As we reported earlier this week, its problems began well before the coronavirus pandemic took root.  History lesson: In the last five years, US shale companies have failed to deliver investor returns and accrued billions of dollars of debt.  Investors made a lot of money when they invested on ""the dip"" around 2009, when oil prices were low.  Those investors helped fuel the fracking revolution of the 2010s, which supercharged America's oil output.  An unintended consequence was that fracking brought M&A — the main source of capital gains for investors — to a near standstill over the following years. (I explain why here.)  So when investors once again backed US shale in the last downturn, beginning around 2014, they never saw returns.  Where we are now: Of the 500 or so US oil and gas companies backed by private equity, about 400 of them don't have bids, according to an investor who's been tracking the industry for years.  That means they'll be forced to go into what he called ""blowdown"" — diverting cash from production to investors, causing oil output to decline over time.  US production could fall by as much as 4 million barrels of oil per day by the end of next year, the investor said.  Where we are headed: ""What you're seeing is the rapid shrinkage of the industry,"" he said. ""A lot of companies are going to cease to exist.""

"In Brief The Facts: A study published in 2015 found that cloth masks can increase healthcare workers risk of infection. It also called into question the efficacy of medical masks.  Reflect On: If masks may not protect healthcare workers in an acute setting, what are they doing for the public? Are the decisions made by health regulatory agencies always in the best interest of the public?  A lot of places are mandating that people wear a mask. Some grocery stores here in Canada are making it mandatory for people who want to do some shopping, and Los Angeles County recently mandated that all people must wear a mask when going outside. But do these measures really help? We are living in strange times when people like Bill Gates are getting a lot of T.V. time, as he seems to be the world’s leading ‘health’ authority on the new coronavirus, what we should do, and how we’re going to stop it. On the other hand, there are several doctors and leading epidemiologists around the world who have been studying viruses for decades that have been censored from social media platforms for sharing their research and opinions. Their interviews are being taken down, and some have even been flagged as ‘fake.’ Ask yourself, what’s wrong with this picture? Many of them are suggesting that the new coronavirus is not nearly as dangerous as it’s being made out to be. There have been multiple studies that have also suggested this based on the data that researchers have accumulated. Mainstream media is trying really hard to shape our perception with regards to everything that surrounds the new coronavirus, from treatment, lockdowns, to social distancing and much more.  We’ve covered a few examples of these experts giving their opinions with regards to how dangerous this virus actually is, what the solution is, treatments and more. If you’re interested you can refer to the articles linked at the bottom of this one. At the end of the day, a lot of what these doctors, scientists and epidemiologists have been saying since the beginning of this outbreak, up until now, has completely contradicted the narrative of federal health regulatory agencies and the World Health Organization (WHO). In fact, social media and other platforms are banning content that opposes and contradicts the WHO, no matter how much evidence is behind the information, or even if the sources are some of the leading experts in the world.  Should there be a digital authoritarian Orwellian ‘fact checker’ going around the internet telling people what is, and what isn’t? Or should people have the right to examine information, check sources and evidence and ultimately decide for themselves?  Special note to our followers: Is 5G safe? Learn the unbiased truth and the steps to implement better solutions in your community at the 5G Health Summit. It’s a free worldwide call to action from the leading independent experts, scientists and doctors in the field. You can sign up here.  So the question is, can we really trust these health authorities to guide us into doing what’s really best for us? Is this really about our health or is something else going on here? Are there powerful people profiting off of this both politically and financially? Was Edward Snowden correct when he said that the new coronavirus fiasco is no different from 9/11, in that it’s simply being used to push more authoritarian measures on the population? Just like they remained after 9/11, will they remain after this coronavirus? Why are there apps tracking people for coronavirus, but not for the pedophiles, murderers and rapists? These are important things to think about.  There is a lot of conflicting information out there and again, if you’re interested in going a little deeper you can refer to the articles listed at the end of this one.  But what about masks? Do they really help? How effective are they? According to Dr. Dan Erickson (former emergency-room physician) and Dr. Artin Massihi (emergency medicine specialist affiliated with multiple hospitals) of Accelerated Urgent Care in California, they’re not helping at all.  When you wear gloves that transfer disease everywhere, those gloves have bacteria all over them. “I’m wearing gloves,” not helping you…Your mask that you’re wearing for days, you touch the outside of it, COVID, and then touch your mouth, this doesn’t make any sense. We wear masks in an acute setting to protect us, we’re not wearing masks (right now). Why is that? Because we understand microbiology, we understand immunology and we want strong immune systems. I don’t want to hide in my home, develop a weak immune system, and then come out and get disease. We’ve both been to the ER through swine flu and through bird flu, did we shut down for those? Were they much less dangerous than COVID? Is the flu less dangerous than COVID? Let’s look at the death rates, no it’s not. They’re similar in prevalence and in death rate. (source)  According to a study published in BMJ Open in 2015,  This study is the first RCT of cloth masks, and the results caution against the use of cloth masks. This is an important finding to inform occupational health and safety. Moisture retention, reuse of cloth masks and poor filtration may result in increased risk of infection. Further research is needed to inform the widespread use of cloth masks globally. However, as a precautionary measure, cloth masks should not be recommended for HCWs, particularly in high-risk situations, and guidelines need to be updated. We have provided the first clinical efficacy data of cloth masks, which suggest HCWs should not use cloth masks as protection against respiratory infection. Cloth masks resulted in significantly higher rates of infection than medical masks, and also performed worse than the control arm. The controls were HCWs who observed standard practice, which involved mask use in the majority, albeit with lower compliance than in the intervention arms. The control HCWs also used medical masks more often than cloth masks. When we analysed all mask-wearers including controls, the higher risk of cloth masks was seen for laboratory-confirmed respiratory viral infection.  According to the study, it was unclear if they help at all, and that they probably need to be worn at all times in acute/dangerous settings within the hospital to be effective at all.  There are also other potential health consequences of wearing not just a cloth mask, but also medical masks. The physiological effects of breathing elevated inhaled CO 2 may include changes in visual performance, modified exercise endurance, headaches and dyspnea. The psychological effects include decreased reasoning and alertness, increased irritability, severe dyspnea, headache, dizziness, perspiration, and short-term memory loss. (source)  This study suggests that masks don’t really help, and depending on the material, they can actually make things worse. That being said, there are studies suggesting that medical masks are indeed effective, but the studies are referring to health care workers in acute settings, not the general public.  Below is a quote from a very interesting paper published in 2016, titled “The Surgical Mask Is A Bad Fit For Risk Reduction.”  As represented by our cinema and other media, Western society expects too much of masks. In the public’s mind, the still-legitimate use of masks for source control has gone off-label; masks are thought to prevent infection. From here, another problem arises: because surgical masks are thought to protect against infection in the community setting, people wearing masks for legitimate purposes (those who have a cough in a hospital, say) form part of the larger misperception and act to reinforce it. Even this proper use of surgical masks is incorporated into a larger improper use in the era of pandemic fear, especially in Asia, where such fear is high. The widespread misconception about the use of surgical masks — that wearing a mask protects against the transmission of virus — is a problem of the kind theorized by German sociologist Ulrich Beck. The birth of the mask came from the realization that surgical wounds need protection from the droplets released in the breath of surgeons. The technology was applied outside the operating room in an effort to control the spread of infectious epidemics. In the 1919 influenza pandemic, masks were available and were dispensed to populations, but they had no impact on the epidemic curve. At the time, it was unknown that the influenza organism is nanoscopic and can theoretically penetrate the surgical mask barrier. As recently as 2010, the US National Academy of Sciences declared that, in the community setting, “face masks are not designed or certified to protect the wearer from exposure to respiratory hazards.” A number of studies have shown the inefficacy of the surgical mask in household settings to prevent transmission of the influenza virus…  Related CE Articles  Italian Politician Says The “Lies & Falsification” of COVID-19 Numbers Is Used To “Terrorize Italians” (VIDEO)  Just Like 9/11 Did, COVID-19 Is Shifting Human Consciousness In A Major Way  Leading Scientist Claims Lockdown & Quarantine is a “Human Catastrophe” (New Interview)  Is The COVID-19 Pandemic Pushing Humanity To Re-Imagine Normal?

"The University of Michigan's consumer-sentiment index gained to 73.7 in May from 71.8 in April according to preliminary data released Friday.  The slight increase was boosted by the current economic conditions index, which jumped to 83 in May from 74.3 in April as coronavirus relief helped consumers.  The index surged ""as the CARES relief checks improved consumers' finances and widespread price discounting boosted their buying attitudes,"" Richard Curtin, Surveys of Consumers chief economist, said in a statement.  Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.  US consumer sentiment rose in May as coronavirus relief helped American households in the short term.  The University of Michigan's consumer-sentiment index gained to 73.7 in May from 71.8 in April according to preliminary data released Friday. The increase was led by a nearly 10-point jump in the current economic conditions index, to 83 in May from 74.3 in April.  The index surged ""as the CARES relief checks improved consumers' finances and widespread price discounting boosted their buying attitudes,"" Richard Curtin, Surveys of Consumers chief economist, said in a statement.  The report is the latest to show the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and sweeping lockdowns to curb the disease on the US economy. While some states are slowly starting to reopen, sparking hope that a recovery will soon be underway, dismal data continues to pour in — US retail sales for April fell 16.4%, the second month in a row of a record slump, according to data released Friday.  The Friday survey so far indicates consumers do not feel good about their future prospects. The index of consumer expectations fell to 67.7 from 70.1 in April, and personal financial prospects for the year ahead fell to the lowest level in almost six years, according to the report.

""The Expectations Index still indicates that no economic restoration is as yet anticipated by consumers,"" said Curtin.  Concerns about social isolation also jumped in April from the previous month — to 21% from 14%. It's now cited as the top concern, overtaking damages to finances, which led the survey in May.

DePaul University and Loyola University of Chicago have consulted with public health experts and state and local officials to devise their plans for the fall semester.  DePaul expects to have limited in-person learning and reduced occupancy in the dorms this fall. Meanwhile, Loyola hopes to offer both on-campus and online classes.  Both universities said they’ll share more details about the fall semester in the coming weeks.  Loyola also announced its “Loyola Commitment,” a new financial aid program, funded by the university and its donors, which will help students who have been affected by the economic downturn amid the pandemic.  “As unemployment rises along with uncertainty about our economic outlook, we will see a sharp increase in students and families whose plans about attending Loyola might be hindered. Dreams are being crushed by diminished family finances,” Loyola provost Norberto Grzywacz wrote in an email to students. “The scale of this crisis and its financial impact on families will have a profound effect on many students from various backgrounds. In particular, it is expected to impact enrollment and our desire for a vibrant and diverse community as a place of growth, experience, and opportunity.”  — Madeline Kenney  8:13 p.m. Work-from-home Congress: House OKs proxy voting for first time  WASHINGTON — Neither Civil War nor Great Depression nor any other national crisis has pushed the House to allow lawmakers to vote by proxy — without being “present,” as the Constitution requires. That’s about to change during the coronavirus pandemic.  The House approved Friday a package of historic rules changes so Congress can keep functioning even while it’s partly closed. The shift will dramatically change the look, if not the operation, of the legislative branch — launching a 21st century WFH House, like others, “working from home.”  “This House must continue legislating,” Rep. Jim McGovern, the chairman of the House Rules Committee, said during a lengthy session ahead of the vote. “And we have to do so in a way that is safe for all those around us.”  Debate over the changes has been fierce. As President Donald Trump encourages Americans back to work, the 435-member House has stayed away due to health risks while the smaller Senate has resumed operations.

In a show of gratitude to a local bridal shop, Novias Davila in Little Village, Jimenez donated official Sox uniforms and funds to the shop, which is making face masks needed for the community during the coronavirus pandemic.  Shop owner Tania Hernández received a video message from Jiménez on Friday, thanking her team for their commitment to the community. Jimenez gave each of seven workers a $500 Jewel-Osco gift card and $500 in cash to provide support during this time.  The Little Village area had the most confirmed coronavirus cases of any single ZIP code in the state as of May 6. Jiménez asked that the face masks are donated to first responders in the neighborhood.  Reporter Daryl Van Schouwen has the full story.  6:41 p.m. Corrupt ex-Ald. Ambrosio Medrano released from prison over coronavirus concerns  Former Chicago Ald. Ambrosio Medrano, convicted three times in corruption scandals, left prison this week as part of an effort to release inmates who are at-risk of contracting the coronavirus.  Federal Bureau of Prisons records show Medrano has been assigned to a residential re-entry management office in the Chicago area. Gal Pissetzky, the attorney who defended Medrano when he was sentenced in federal court six years ago, said Medrano is in a halfway house.  But for the rest of Medrano’s sentence, Pissetzky said, “he’s going to be on home confinement.” Medrano’s official release date isn’t until Sept. 14, 2025, prison records show.

As a commercial resort photographer, she travels over 100,000 miles each year, capturing luxurious images in places like Cabo and the Maldives.  So when the coronavirus started to spread and travel bans went into effect, Treimer was furloughed — for three months at least, and maybe longer.  “For the first time in three years, I wasn’t living on an airplane, you know? Whenever we were advised by the CDC to not travel, my world kind of flipped upside down,” she said. “I just started brainstorming: What am I going to do for the next three months? This is the first time in my life that I haven’t had a 9 to 5.”  Searching for normalcy and human connection, she decided to look for beauty elsewhere.

It’s unclear when Chicago’s 81 libraries will reopen, but staff are returning to their jobs Wednesday to prepare for the day when doors will be flung open and patrons will be welcomed back.  “Absolutely no date has been set to open libraries to the public, and any reopening decision would be consistent with public health guidance and dependent on where our data is at that time,” Jordan Troy, a spokesman for Mayor Lightfoot, said in an email Friday.  “As the mayor has stated since the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis, every decision made in city government will be guided by science and data.”  Libraries have been closed since March 21.

With the latest 130 deaths, the state has lost 1,727 people so far in May, and 4,058 overall.  There were also 2,432 more people testing positive among the latest batch of 26,565 test results, officials said. And Edgar County became the 100th county to record positive cases in the state.  There have been 90,369 confirmed coronavirus cases since the pandemic began.  The state’s overall positivity rate — the number of positive cases compared to total tests received — was 9.1%. And the Northeast region, home to Chicago, Cook and the collar counties, remained under 20%, a benchmark set for further to enter the next phase of Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s regional reopening plan.  Read the full report from Tina Sfondeles here.  2:36 p.m. Cook County surpasses Queens, NY, as county with most COVID-19 cases in U.S.  Cook County has surpassed Queens County in New York as the U.S. county with the most coronavirus cases based on Sun-Times analysis of the latest public data.  There have been 58,457 total cases of COVID-19 recorded in Cook County, which includes all of Chicago and many of its suburbs, after officials added 2,051 new cases in the last 24 hours. Queens, by comparison, added only 336 cases over the same time frame to bring its total to 58,084.  Cook County still has a lower rate of COVID-19 per capita given its population (5.1 million) is more than twice as large as Queens (2.25 million). But Queens also has a much higher population density with 20,500 people per square mile compared to 5,500 per square mile in Cook County, which can make social distancing measures more challenging to maintain.  1:55 p.m. Lightfoot hints at street closures to help restaurants  Is Mayor Lori Lightfoot planning to close streets and sidewalks so restaurants can safely reopen and give residents a place to run, walk and play? Sure sounds like it.  “People are itching to get outside. Businesses are looking at creative ways to serve customers. The key is how we do it,” the mayor tweeted Friday.  “Stay tuned for some changes to our streets and sidewalks. Transportation is more than just cars. We’ll show how Chicago can be safer and easier to get around.”  Last week, Illinois Restaurant Association President Sam Toia urged Gov. J.B. Pritzker to relax his five-step plan to reopen Illinois by allowing restaurants to open at 25% of capacity beginning June 1 with strict safeguards for restaurant employees, including face masks and daily temperature checks.  At the time, Toia teased the street closing idea.

J.B. Pritzker’s stay-at-home order — and warned she is prepared to “enforce the rules” if they don’t.  In a “Dear Members of the Chicago Faith Community” letter sent Thursday, Lightfoot urged religious leaders to continue holding virtual services rather than in-person services, where it is difficult, if not impossible, to maintain social distance.  “I am urging you to stay the course. If there is a problem, I would rather be in conversation than in conflict. But to be clear, I am resolute that I must enforce the rules of the governor’s stay-at-home order. To be fair to all, I simply cannot look away from non-compliance, no matter the source or the intention,” she wrote.  On Monday, Lightfoot responded to Sunday service defiance by saying she hoped to educate religious leaders into compliance, avoiding mass arrests.  “We’re not gonna send in the police to arrest parishioners. People are exercising their faith, and I understand that,” she said then.  But the next day, the mayor made it clear she was serious about enforcing the governor’s order and she would do what she must.

According to a story published by The Athletic, Ricketts said the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, conflicts over the best time to reopen businesses, and continuing negotiations between the owners and players could combine to prevent the start of the season.  “I don’t think anyone can answer that question just yet,” Ricketts said during a virtual forum with season-ticket holders Thursday. “The current thinking and the current discussions (among owners) have been all around trying to get back into our home ballparks for this season. Obviously, without fans. Now that creates three specific problems that we have to address.”  The team has been consulting with health professionals on the best way to make Wrigley Field safe, according to a recording of Cubs president Crane Kenney obtained by The Athletic.  — Sun-Times Staff  12:26 p.m. The high cost of quarantine  In a letter to the Sun-Times editors, Tom Gregg of Niles writes:  Before the quarantine, I was visiting my 99-year-old mother twice a day in our retirement home, and she was holding her own in terms of her health. She is vision-impaired, hearing-impaired, arthritic and suffering from mild dementia, certainly, but for 13 years in two homes she had largely been able to avoid hospital stays for life-threatening problems. Plus, her interaction with me seemed to greatly help in minimizing her spells of confusion.  But now, during our relatively brief period of enforced separation — I live on a lower floor while she lives up on an assisted living floor — she has contracted pneumonia, for which she has been in and out of hospital, and her spells of confusion seem to be worsening. Symptomatic, doubtless, of the unprecedented disorientation.  My mother remains among the living today, but for how long if she remains so isolated? Now multiply this single case by all the other seniors around the country who have seen their precious interactive routines disappear. It is a situation that many of them, given their cognitive limitations, have difficulty grasping.  This potentially lethal hardship is worth noting when we are formulating pandemic recovery plans. The cure of the quarantine shouldn’t cost more than the contagion itself, should it?  Read this and more letters here.  11:44 a.m. What’s the first meal you’ll want at a restaurant post-pandemic? We asked, Chicagoans answered.  With eat-in dining at restaurants on hold because of the state’s coronavirus stay-at-home order, the next time you’ll be waited on at a restaurant probably won’t be for a while.  Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s five-phase plan for reopening Illinois businesses puts restaurant reopenings in Phase 4. We’re now in Phase 2.  So with Chicagoans craving a meal out, we asked: Once restaurants reopen for dining in, what’s the first meal you’ll want to eat out, and from where? Some of these answers have been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.  “Breakfast at a Greek joint: feta cheese-and-spinach omelet, hashbrowns and an English muffin or pancakes.” — Rose Panieri  “A hamburger from Charlie Beinlich’s in Glencoe.” — Elena Zaremski  “Tango Sur — the filet with spinach mashed potatoes.” — Marcela Guzman  Read more answers from our readers here.  10:08 a.m. How we should honor our youngest COVID-19 victim  Ernesto Guzman, age 12, suffered from asthma and obstructive sleep apnea, two other underlying health problems with potentially serious consequences that have figured into many other COVID-19 deaths, according to the Cook County Medical Examiner’s office.  But make no mistake, doctors say it was the coronavirus that caused the pneumonia that took Ernesto’s life early Thursday morning at Advocate Christ Medical Center, Oak Lawn.  Because his death occurred after midnight, it is not yet counted among the 3,928 official COVID-19 deaths in Illinois, but it was listed among the single-day record high of 126 deaths reported Thursday from Cook County by the medical examiner.  Will the death of a 12-year-old boy cause more people to take this disease seriously? Mark Brown says he doubts it. But he hopes that will change.  “Take this seriously, folks,” he wrote. “Take it very seriously, because the life you risk may not be your own.”  Read Mark Brown’s full column here.  8:49 a.m. Abbott rapid COVID-19 test may yield false negatives, FDA warns  The federal Food and Drug Administration issued a warning Thursday night that early data suggests Abbott Laboratories’ rapid coronavirus test, touted by the Trump administration as a game changer, may return inaccurate and false negative results — findings the Chicago-area firm vehemently denied.  The Abbott ID NOW test — which can provide results in minutes — is used by the White House to quickly test anyone who comes into proximity of President Donald Trump. Trump has lavished attention on the Abbott ID NOW test and featured it at a White House event three days after the FDA fast-tracked its approval by granting an emergency use authorization on March 27.  In just a few weeks time, Abbott has shipped 1.8 million of the ID NOW tests, which is used at several Chicago-area testing sites.  The FDA warning came a day after a New York University preliminary study raised questions about its accuracy. The study was not subject to peer review, a process that checks on the procedures used for a study as well as its findings.  Read the full story here.  7:03 a.m. ‘Grandstanding’ by Grand Old Party? Or is Pritzker masking his decisions?  SPRINGFIELD — After weeks of nudges from Republican legislators, the General Assembly is planning to return to Springfield to get back to work.  And as they prepare for the Legislature’s long-sought session next week, Republicans said Thursday they are willing to comply with safety guidelines issued by the Democrats – but they want an examination of their own.  GOP lawmakers said they will wear face coverings, submit to COVID-19 tests and temperature checks and follow other safety measures when they return to Springfield, but they balked at signing a pledge to follow those recommendations as requested by House Speaker Mike Madigan.  And Republicans want to put Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s “Restore Illinois” plan under the microscope with a public hearing.  GOP lawmakers have criticized Pritzker’s “Restore Illinois” plan as “arbitrary,” saying the dates in which parts of the states can begin to reopen don’t make sense, and its metrics ignore geographical differences in COVID-19’s impact.

Normally, the city issues general obligation bonds backed by property taxes to cover a more sweeping capital program. But these are not normal times.  The Lightfoot administration is preoccupied with the city’s response to the coronavirus and the budget crisis triggered by the stay-at-home shutdown of the Chicago economy.  So the decision was made to proceed only with those capital projects and purchases that absolutely needed to get done and to finance it with a line of credit that remained, even after Lightfoot saved $22 million by eliminating a $1.4 billion line of credit negotiated by former Mayor Rahm Emanuel.

New cases  Analysis & Commentary  7:47 p.m. Everything must be on the table as city, state fight back from financial devastation  Washington to cities and states: You’re on your own.  For months, the Trump administration has failed to take the lead in fighting the coronavirus pandemic, punting responsibility to the states. Now the president and his Republican Party are looking to do the same when it comes to helping states and cities survive the pandemic’s financial devastation.  A $3 trillion stimulus package expected to be approved by the Democratic-controlled House looks dead on arrival in the Republican-controlled Senate, and President Donald Trump is making clear he would never sign such a bill.  Why? Because the package to rescue drowning cities, suburbs, states, small businesses and unemployed Americans would be fiscally imprudent, they claim.  We couldn’t disagree more. And, yes, this is the same Senate and president who rewrote the federal tax code in 2017 to give billions of dollars in tax cuts to the wealthiest one percent of Americans, ballooning the federal deficit.  So what does all this mean for Illinois and Chicago, as well as for towns and counties statewide?  Read the full editorial from the CST Editorial Board here.  6:35 p.m. Gov. Pritzker fumbles rollout of ‘Restore Illinois’  For many weeks after the beginning of this COVID-19 crisis, Gov. J.B. Pritzker proved adept at telegraphing his every move.  Pritzker waited until people practically begged him to shut down the schools on March 15. He talked about issuing a stay-at-home order for days, and then acted on March 21 only after California jumped first.  It was clear for days that he would extend his stay-at-home order another month starting April 1. He talked for well over a week about a mask-wearing requirement, always noting that he was being lobbied by Republican state Rep. Mark Batinick before finally announcing the order on April 23.  People did not always agreed with him, but they always had a sense of where he was going. Pritzker did get out over his skis when his Illinois Workers’ Compensation Commission dramatically altered the burden of proof on COVID-19 illnesses in favor of employees without so much as a heads-up to business groups. But most regular folks never noticed that and a court intervened and stopped the order anyway.  Otherwise, the governor did a remarkably good job of making sure the public was always aware in advance of his leadership direction.  And then on May 5 he announced his “Restore Illinois” roadmap to gradually reopen the state.

Maybe it’s best we just leave the flag as it is, even if the city manages to prevail against COVID-19.  Last Friday and again on Wednesday, Mayor Lori Lightfoot floated the idea of adding a fifth red star to Chicago’s flag to mark the city’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. She was trying to rally the city. If Chicago’s effort to beat the virus is terrifically successful, she said Friday, it will “truly warrant a fifth star on our flag.”  But let’s be blunt. Chicago’s not about to be terrifically successful anytime soon. Nobody is. This is a global public health war that’s sure to be fought for years, and a lot of people are setting us up to lose.

Navy Pier Inc., which leases the 104-year-old pier from the public, is a government body that masquerades as a nonprofit organization. As such, it has been allowed to hide its workings from public scrutiny while benefiting from public support.  Navy Pier Inc. pays just $1 a year to the state and city to lease the pier.  And just this week, Sun-Times reporters Tim Novak and Robert Herguth revealed that the organization, whose president is paid more than $540,000 a year, has received a nearly $2.5 million coronavirus stimulus loan from the federal government’s Paycheck Protection Program.  Like all nonprofits, Navy Pier Inc. must disclose much of its finances by filing 990 forms, but it does not have to comply with Freedom of Information Act requests or disclose the terms of contracts.

"The British government has openly allied with the US in backing Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó's self-appointment as interim president. But newly obtained government documents by a UK-based investigative journalist reveal a much deeper relationship with members of the coup-government-in-waiting.  John McEvoy is an independent journalist who has published in the International History Review, The Canary, Tribune Magazine, Jacobin, Declassified UK, Brasil Wire among other publications. He reported from Venezuela during the coup efforts in 2019, from Colombia during the student protests the same year and from France in 2020 on the Yellow Vests movement and general strike.  Mr McEvoy's main research focus is in contemporary British involvement in Latin America - notably British state intervention and natural resource extraction in Colombia since 1989. He speaks English, Spanish and French.  Sputnik: You recently published an exposé revealing the existence of a secret unit working within the UK Foreign Office that was liaising with elements of the Venezuelan opposition.  What exactly did you discover?  John McEvoy: I discovered a Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) Unit named the Venezuela Reconstruction Unit, which hadn't previously been acknowledged by either the government, the diplomat involved, nor the Venezuelan opposition, with whom the unit has collaborated.  It was also found that Juan Guaidó's representative in the UK, Vanessa Neumann, had spoke with FCO officials about the sustenance of British business interests in Venezuela's 'reconstruction'. Given Venezuela sits on the largest proven oil reserves in the world, and Neumann's past links with oil corporations, we can only imagine what this means.  Sputnik: Who are the key players in this unit?  John McEvoy: The only diplomat that we know is involved thus far is John Saville, the former UK ambassador to Venezuela between 2014 and 2017. He's been a diplomat for some decades.  Sputnik: Why is this significant, why should this matter to anyone living in Britain?  John McEvoy: It's obviously important for UK citizens to know what is being done in their name - be it at home or abroad. In the case of Venezuela, which is undergoing a serious political and economic crisis, it's important that UK citizens know how the UK government is contributing to this - through sanctions, partnering with the US in trying to destabilise the country, and in planning for the country's 'reconstruction' following an imagined coup.  When you look at the past record of British destabilisation and 'reconstruction' - in Iraq, Libya, Syria, or Afghanistan, for instance - you get the kind of idea of what might await Venezuela should the government be overthrown. But it's not just about a utilitarian approach, it's also about confronting imperialism. What right does the UK government have in the 'reconstruction' of another sovereign nation?  I'm sure the British population would be alarmed if it were to learn that Venezuela had a specialist unit within its Ministry of External Affairs planning for the 'reconstruction' of Britain.  Sputnik: Did the Foreign Office have an explanation for the existence of this unit?  John McEvoy: The FCO responded in a way that has characterised British public diplomacy over recent years: that they're trying to 'help' Venezuelans resolve their 'appalling political and economic crisis'. Even the smallest understanding of British foreign policy, and the history of British interventions abroad, would lead one to immediately suspect this explanation. That's before considering the numerous different ways in which the British government has joined in with the economic strangulation of Venezuela over the past 16 months - notably in freezing over $1bn worth of Venezuelan gold held in the Bank of England.  These sanctions are even more concerning in light of the current coronavirus - Venezuela is struggling to import vital medication for years. What's more, if the Venezuela Reconstruction Unit is so committed to benign objectives such as democracy promotion and political assistance, it's quite a wonder why they kept silent about it since Autumn 2019.  Sputnik: How would you respond to someone who says that it isn't that big a deal for the UK Foreign Office to have a group of people whose job is to liaise with opposition figures in another country?  John McEvoy: Of course it's within the FCO's remit to liaise with foreign politicians and diplomats. In this case, those with whom it is liaising have been trying to violently overthrow their elected government for the past 16 months (and, in the wider context, since Hugo Chavez was first elected in 1998). The most recent instance came to a head this month when US and Venezuelan mercenaries arrived on the Venezuelan coasts with plans to kidnap the president and gun down ""violent colectivos"" - which is frequently a code-word for working class, usually socialist communities in Venezuela who support the legitimacy and sovereignty of their government and state.  In March and April 2019, I stayed with the leader of a colectivo in Caracas, Venezuela, for two weeks. This colectivo was dedicated to helping the local children with cultural events and activities - dance, theatre, art, etc. Yet in the international media, colectivos have been comprehensively painted as violent, thuggish supporters of the Venezuelan government. Painting them as 'thugs' or 'terrorists' provides a pre-emptive justification for attacking supporters of the government and those who defend the sovereignty of the Venezuelan state.  What this [recent mercenary] plan entailed was a possible massacre of the Venezuelans who would inevitably come out in defence of the sovereignty of their state. The contract for this operation reportedly bears Juan Guaidó's signature and he is named as the operation's Commander in Chief - and these plans were underway when Guaidó visited the UK in January 2020. This is, therefore, a unique situation - the UK government is collaborating, at the highest levels, with political forces that are involved in what many would describe as terrorism.  Sputnik: Is there anything about their activities that you still don't know that you want to know?  John McEvoy: Yes - another Freedom of Information request has been sent; hopefully there'll be a follow-up article on this latest piece.  The views and opinions expressed in the article do not necessarily reflect those of Sputnik.",0
"US President Barack Obama meets with President-elect Donald Trump to update him on transition planning in the Oval Office at the White House on November 10, 2016  Former President Barack Obama criticized the federal government's coronavirus response in a thinly veiled swipe at the Trump administration during a virtual commencement address delivered to historically black colleges and universities on Saturday.  ""More than anything, this pandemic has fully, finally torn back the curtain on the idea that so many of the folks in charge know what they're doing,"" Obama said in his speech. ""A lot of them aren't even pretending to be in charge.""  These latest comments could ignite further tension between Obama and President Donald Trump. Obama previously criticized the Trump administration last week, when he called its Covid-19 response ""an absolute chaotic disaster"" during a private call with supporters who formerly worked for him.  Back in March, Trump blamed the country's lack of coronavirus tests on the previous administration. He has also tried to blame the Obama administration for the lack of a vaccine.  ""I don't take responsibility at all,"" Trump said at a press briefing. ""Because we were given a — a set of circumstances, and we were given rules, regulations and specifications from a different time.""    One of Trump's own top health advisors, Dr. Anthony Fauci, dismissed the idea that Obama was responsible for the lack of a vaccine during a Senate hearing this week.    The White House responded to Obama's speech with a statement defending Trump's coronavirus response, claiming it had ""saved lives."" At least 88,437 Americans have died from coronavirus and more than 1.4 million have been infected, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.  Streamed online, Obama's speech mentioned the difficult circumstances facing graduates that stem from the pandemic, including the current economic recession. In addressing the country's 78 HBCUs, he also made reference to enduring racial inequality in the U.S., which he said can be viewed in how the pandemic is disproportionately affecting people of color as well as the recent death of Ahmaud Arbery, a black man who was allegedly shot by two white men in Georgia while jogging. Though Arbery died in February, the two men allegedly responsible were not arrested until May after a video that is said to depict the shooting went viral.  ""We see it in the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on our communities, just as we see it when a black man goes for a jog, and some folks feel like they can stop and question and shoot him if he doesn't submit to their questioning,"" Obama said during the speech. ""Injustice like this isn't new. What is new is that so much of your generation has woken up to the fact that the status quo needs fixing.""  Obama ended the speech on a note of optimism for the class of 2020, saying that the graduates were all ""role models"" now.  ""Your participation in this democracy, your courage to stand up for what's right, your willingness to forge coalitions — these actions will speak volumes,"" he said.",1
"Texas COVID-19 cases rise, governor's office says more testing being done The deaths are also steadily increasing.  What to know about antibody testing  What to know about antibody testing Callaghan O'hare/Reuters  Texas has seen a steady rise in novel coronavirus cases and fatalities since reopening just over two weeks ago.  There are now 45,198 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. That is an increase of 1,347 cases from Thursday to Friday. The new numbers have not yet been recorded for Saturday.  Last Friday, the daily case increase was 1,219.  Registered nurse April Lewis, center, prepares to administer a test at a newly opened United Memorial Medical Center COVID-19 drive-thru testing site, April 27, 2020, in Houston. David J. Phillip/AP  While the cases are still well below New York, the state with the most confirmed cases at more than 345,000, the steady increase shows that the curve has not yet flattened in Texas.  The state also experienced its highest and second-highest daily death toll just a day apart. On Thursday, 58 deaths were recorded in 24 hours and Friday that number dropped only slightly to 56, according to the health department. The total number of fatalities is at 1,272.  Last Friday, the daily death toll was 31.  Hospitalizations rates have appeared to flatten, but that data is reported on a two-week lag. Currently there are 1,716 people in a Texas hospital, according to the health department.  Gov. Greg Abbott's communications director John Wittman told ABC News that the amount of testing has doubled since reopening, contributing to the rise in cases.  ""Since [COVID-19 testing] started, we did 330,000 tests in March and April. Since May 1, we have done over 330,000 -- so in 16 days we have doubled our testing from the previous entire two months,"" Wittman said.  ""The governor has been clear that as the state of Texas conducts more tests, we will see the raw number of cases rise,"" Wittman said. ""However, the [rolling seven-day] average positivity rate has steadily declined from our high April 13 [of a bit more than 13%] to around 5% today. Our hospitalizations remain steady, and Texas has one of the lowest death rates per capita in the nation.""  Texas began reopening after its stay-at-home order was lifted on April 30.

There are 8,817 confirmed cases in Harris County and 6,837 confirmed cases in Dallas County.  The state has tested nearly 646,000 people out of a population of 29 million.

Also, the number of homes Americans pulled off the market that were unsold — known as ""delistings"" — peaked in the 28-day period ended April 9, when 7.2% of active listings were delisted across Redfin's business markets.

"'She Wasn't Alone,' A Doctor Reflects On New York City's Coronavirus Peak  Enlarge this image toggle caption Elias Williams for NPR Elias Williams for NPR  On the night of March 30, just before 7 p.m., Dr. Ray Lorenzoni put on his face mask, walked across the street from the Bronx apartment he shares with his wife and started his shift at the Children's Hospital at Montefiore Medical Center.  Lorenzoni, 35, is in his second year of a pediatric cardiology fellowship at the hospital. But this night, the patients would be different: It was his first shift treating adult coronavirus patients — the first adults he's treated in the hospital since medical school six years before.  ""Coming into the hospital, it was a little bit unreal,"" he says. ""The whole floor was filled with adult patients.""  By then, COVID-19 cases systemwide at Montefiore Medical Center had gone from just two cases a little over two weeks earlier to more than 700. In response, Montefiore transformed part of the children's hospital into a 40-bed adult COVID unit. All around the city, other hospitals were making similar adjustments. Medical students graduated early. Operating rooms were converted into ICUs. A field hospital went up in Central Park.  But the surge in New York City has done much more than simply rearrange space and upend protocol. More than 15,000 people have died of COVID-19 there, and that enormous toll will profoundly impact the city's tens of thousands of health care workers for years to come. Lorenzoni is one of them.  A little over a month ago, Lorenzoni answered a request from NPR for hospital workers to describe what work was like at the epicenter of the crisis. Lorenzoni began recording his reflections for NPR after his shifts, sitting at the desk in his bedroom, speaking into his iPhone in a slow, measured voice.  Just a few weeks earlier, Lorenzoni had watched — along with many other Americans — how the Italian medical system had been brought to its knees. It seemed likely it was only a matter of when, not if, the coronavirus would arrive in the U.S. And of course, by then, it already had.  ""I knew I could be involved because of what happened in Italy,"" Lorenzoni says, and adds, ""a pediatric physician needing to take care of critical adult patients is unheard of.""  Still, he was surprised he was recruited so early.  ""They filled us up pretty quickly and the patients were very sick. I remember in the first couple shifts we were putting breathing tubes in patients on a floor that doesn't usually do that,"" he says.  Treating adults hit him hard, he says. He's used to working with kids.  ""Pediatrics is a career where most of your patients get better,"" he says. ""But these were very with-it adults who were scared. They knew what the risk was.""  It felt important to him, he says, to be honest about what was happening, even when the news wasn't good.  ""One of my main mantras is to sit down with somebody. And that was very tough in this environment because our protective equipment didn't surround us,"" he says. ""So we were discouraged from sitting down on the bed next to a patient to have a deep discussion or sitting down in a chair and being at eye level with the patient.""  Instead, he says he would do his best to give his patient a sense of comfort by leaning against the wall, trying not to stand over or talk down to them.  ""I think patients can see right through a physician when they try to dance around a difficult conversation,"" he says. ""You can be honest with a person and they appreciate that honesty.""  One patient, a man in his mid-forties, kept asking how bad his condition was. As the man's health deteriorated, Lorenzoni was open with him, aware that those hard conversations — like what it means to be put on a ventilator — are sometimes the last a patient will ever have.  ""I remember that he asked me, 'doc, I know I'm not getting better, what else can we do?' and unfortunately I had to answer that we'd been doing everything we could. And he broke down. And I broke down a little bit in tears,"" he says.  Enlarge this image toggle caption Elias Williams for NPR Elias Williams for NPR  In his recordings, Lorenzoni lingered on the quieter moments. He spoke about why it was important to take time with his patients, especially because visitors were not allowed. One woman, in her early 30s, often wanted staff to check in on her, beyond the usual rounds that doctors and nurses make.  ""I feel like she knew she wasn't doing well, and she wanted the company,"" Lorenzoni says.  When he would leave for the day, he'd check in on her to make sure she was okay, but he worried that she would take a turn for the worse by the time he returned.  Eventually, that's what happened. She needed to be placed on a ventilator to breathe.  ""One of the things I remember before the breathing tube was placed was simply sitting by her side and telling her what was going to happen. And what we could and couldn't do to help,"" he remembers. ""She was scared about how little control she had or even the doctors had in how she did.""  Lorenzoni transferred her to an ICU, an operating room that had been converted. His shift was ending, and he signed out his other patients, but he stayed on to be with this one during the intubation.  ""When her body didn't respond well to that, because it was so weak, I was there doing chest compressions on her,"" he says. ""And I signed her death certificate afterwards. It was a tough day.""  She was the first of his patients to die.  ""Although she passed away without her family by her side, she wasn't alone,"" he says. ""I hope that even this small amount of company that she had at the end was comforting for her. And it's going to be one of the things that sticks with me for the rest of my career.""  Many of the people who have died from COVID-19 in New York had underlying health conditions, like diabetes and high blood pressure, and that's true in Lorenzoni's experience as well. But he says conditions that put someone at a higher risk are much more common than people realize.  ""These are people that we know. These are people that we're related to,"" he says. ""It's either yourself, or your neighbor, or people that you work with.""  Hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19 have been decreasing for a few weeks now in New York, and Lorenzoni is back on pediatrics. It's a welcome relief for now, but he says if there's another surge, he could be called back.",1
"Sally Greenberg  Opinion contributor  We are all adapting to the new normal of navigating COVID-19, with innovative approaches emerging. But not all are good ideas. A case in point is the Republican leadership’s proposals to immunize businesses from accountability if they follow “government guidelines” for operating “safely.” They make it sound reasonable, but when you take a closer look, the proposals would actually jeopardize both workers and consumers and damage our economic recovery.  Many companies are doing their best to address COVID-19 by keeping their workers and customers safe and offering paid leave to employees who show symptoms. But immunizing all companies based on compliance with guidelines is problematic.  First, no authoritative guidelines exist. The Trump administration recently blocked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s detailed reopening guidelines for certain industries because they were overly prescriptive, according to The Associated Press.  The only other federal guidelines, from the CDC and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, offer ""recommendations” rather than actual rules. Similarly, some states have created their own guidelines, but they vary greatly.  We know that certain industries have failed to take reasonable precautions to protect the public and their workforce. What standards will they be held to? Even if such guidelines existed, accountability should never be based solely on compliance with standards. In fact, under current law, compliance with government standards is already a defense from liability; if the standards are sound and a business has complied, companies face no liability. However, all the facts must be considered, including whether the standards are sufficient and applicable to the particular situation.  OUR VIEW:Coronavirus lawsuits immunity requires public health guidelines  American Association for Justice:Blanket legal immunity will prolong pandemic  The Chamber of Commerce, which is supporting immunity, recently wrote that a “one-size-fits-all regulatory approach is simply impossible when talking about adapting safety measures for every workplace in America.”  This is exactly why the flexibility that exists in current rules works — to determine whether a business acted reasonably toward consumers and workers. Congress shouldn’t add another layer of broad immunity based on phantom guidelines and politicians’ whims.  Sally Greenberg is the executive director of the National Consumers League.

"AUSTIN, Texas – Ron Wilkins endured 37 days on a ventilator, a failed kidney, medical paralysis and a mountain of medical bills.  As he slowly recovers from a near-death bout of COVID-19, the disease brought on by the coronavirus, at an acute care hospital near San Antonio, Wilkins and his loved ones face a new worry: states pushing to reopen stores and economies.  ""People don’t really understand how serious this is until they know somebody who's going through it,"" said Rebecca Patterson, Wilkins' longtime girlfriend. ""It's only a matter of time before everyone in the country knows someone.""  She added, ""I don’t know what the solution is, but I don’t think hurrying to open things up is it.""  Thousands of coronavirus survivors are returning home after long, harrowing hospital stays to face lingering symptoms, job losses, staggering medical bills and stigma attached to surviving the virus that has infected roughly 1.5 million people in the USA and killed nearly 90,000.  Coronavirus may last 2 years, study warns: And its second wave could be worse  Many worry that states rushing to rescind stay-at-home orders and allow businesses to reopen will unleash a new wave of infections.  The debate over how fast states should reignite their economies flared last week when Dr. Rick Bright, a government immunologist, told a congressional committee that the window is closing fast to prevent the “darkest winter in modern history” if the nation doesn’t improve its response to the coronavirus.  Bright filed a whistleblower complaint alleging he was ousted from his federal post in retaliation for his views. President Donald Trump called Bright an ""angry, disgruntled employee"" and has continued pushing states to reopen and rekindle the struggling economy.  Leaders in some states, including Wisconsin and Texas, advocated for the reopening of small businesses with the same guidelines as essential services, such as supermarkets, even as their COVID-19 cases mount.  Last week, the Wisconsin Supreme Court eliminated Democratic Gov. Tony Evers' stay-at-home order, prompting patrons to stream into bars and restaurants across the state.  ""Do we need statewide rules for the run-of-the-mill opening of restaurants or small retailers? I don’t think so,” state Rep. Joan Ballweg told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.  Dashauna Ballard, 28, an educator from Tuscaloosa, Alabama, said state officials would slow the pace of reopenings if they'd been through a COVID-19 scare. Ballard tested positive for the disease in early April after experiencing body aches, fatigue, fever and shortness of breath. She drove herself to a hospital and spent eight hours in the intensive care unit as doctors debated putting her on a ventilator.  Her breathing improved the next day, and she was released. Her job working with at-risk high school students was suspended, and school officials were wary of letting her return to campus to collect her personal items after learning she had contracted the virus, she said. Some friends have been reluctant to meet with her after discovering she had COVID-19.  Despite the stigma and uncertain economic future, Ballard said she's glad to be feeling better and recovering at her mother's home in Selma. She's worried states will reopen too soon.  ""You are just potentially making the problem worse,"" Ballard said. ""It's not something you'll want to go through. ... You don’t want to feel that feeling of your breath taken away when you bend down to tie your shoes. You don't want to go through that, no matter what age you are.""  Dr. Omar Maniya, an emergency medicine resident at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan, has seen both sides of the pandemic. Working in the hospital's emergency department, he's treated almost 200 COVID-19 patients, seen them struggling to breathe and had scores of them die on his shift.  One day in early March, Maniya woke up with chills, body aches and a fever that spiked to 102. As was the protocol at the time, he stayed home for a week, until his symptoms passed, then returned to work. He tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies, a sign that he probably had the disease.  Maniya said he's worried that as states reopen, they'll experience the surge that hit New York, which leads the nation in confirmed cases (350,000) and deaths (28,000).  ""I fear that many people around the country not experiencing this in their state are rolling their eyes thinking, 'It's not going to happen here,' "" Maniya said. ""A majority of states still have rising cases every day. I don’t think this is, by any means, under control.""  Virginia Bennett, 77, is an active grandmother of four. She shuttled between her home in Indiana and her winter home in Naples, Florida, and took line dancing classes five days a week.  In mid-March, she felt suddenly ill in Naples and went to a hospital. X-rays showed her lungs ravaged by the virus. Doctors moved her to an ICU and placed her on a ventilator immediately, where she spent the next 36 days. Family members had no access to her, relying on twice-a-day phone updates from doctors and nurses.  Slowly, in early May, she began to improve and was released from the hospital May 8. Masked doctors, nurses and technicians applauded as Bennett was wheeled out of the hospital to the sounds of the Beatles' ""Here Comes the Sun"" playing on the hospital PA system.  Bennett was transferred to another critical care hospital, where she would begin her long recovery from the disease, daughter Jennifer Grytza said. Doctors said Bennett might be at her new hospital for several more months.  Before COVID-19 nearly took her mom's life, Grytza, a sales manager at a hotel chain who lost her job early in the pandemic, said she believed states should reopen as soon as possible. Now, she's not so sure.  ""I know people need to get back to work,"" she said. ""I want to say, 'Let's reopen, but do it with caution and sensitivity to your neighbors and friends.' ""  Alice Police, a Westchester, New York, breast cancer surgeon, thought she could ride out the virus at home in late March when she was hit with flu-like symptoms and tested positive for COVID-19. As her condition worsened, she was admitted to a hospital in early April.  Doctors discovered Police was experiencing what's known as a ""cytokine storm,"" in which the body releases a surge of immune responses to combat a virus, a condition that could turn deadly.  “It’s like a thunderstorm for the body,” Police, 66, said. ""It’s where the body is basically willing to kill you to kill the virus.”  Police was diagnosed with pneumonia. She was never intubated but struggled to breathe. She suffered from anxiety attacks, especially at night. After a few days, her condition improved, and five days later, she was released from the hospital. Later, symptoms reemerged, and Police returned to the hospital for a plasma infusion.  Recovering at home, she said she feels the country and its leaders are not taking the contagion seriously enough.  “This push to reopen is very, very wrong and short-sighted,” Police said. “The second wave could be worse.”  As the coronavirus began its explosive spread across New York City in March, Wilkins, 62, a well-known trombonist in New York, chose to ride out the pandemic with his mother and relatives in his hometown of San Antonio. In late March, he complained of congestion and fatigue but thought it was allergies flaring up.  On April 4, he texted Patterson, his longtime girlfriend, to tell her he felt ""much better."" Two hours later, Wilkins was rushed to the hospital, unresponsive, and immediately placed on a ventilator.  ""It just escalated so quickly,"" Patterson said.  For the next 30 days, Wilkins was heavily sedated and struggling to breathe. The recipient of a kidney transplant six years ago, his only working kidney failed, and he had to be placed on dialysis. His white blood cell count shot up, and his blood pressure plummeted. He received a tracheotomy to make it easier for air to enter his lungs.  Doctors called Patterson to tell her Wilkins might not make it through the day. She rushed to the hospital and spoke to him from the nurse's station via a walkie talkie that a nurse held up to Wilkin's ear in his room.  ""Hang in there,"" Patterson told him. ""I know it's not your time, and we'll be hanging out again soon.""  Slowly, in early May, his condition began to improve. He was able to breathe on his own and was transferred to a long-term acute care hospital in nearby New Braunfels. Thursday, he took his first bite of solid food in over a month.  Patterson said she doesn't know how soon Wilkins can return to his music career or whether there will be much of an industry left when he does. Wilkins, an Air Force veteran, has health insurance underthe Department of Veterans Affairs,but Patterson suspects it won't cover most of his medical bills, which she expects will be staggering. She started a GoFundMe.com site and personal website to try to raise money to cover his medical expenses.  Patterson relishes Wilkins' small victories, such as forming a few words using a Passy-Muir speaking valve and regaining the use of his fingers.  ""It doesn't matter how old you are,"" she said. ""It's a serious disease with long-term effects.""  Follow Jervis on Twitter: @MrRJervis.",1
"Presidential reelection campaigns are generally referendums on the incumbent. A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.  By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”  But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.  Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.  Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”  When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.  Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.  “The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham  But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”  The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.  When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”  A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.  Others are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)",1
"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s $266 billion economic rescue package rests mostly on boosting company credit but contains scant new public spending, tax breaks or cash support to revive demand and prevent firms from collapsing, business leaders and economists say.  FILE PHOTO: Migrant workers rest as they wait to cross the border to reach their home state of Uttar Pradesh, during an extended nationwide lockdown to slow the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), on the outskirts of New Delhi, India, May 18, 2020. REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui  Businesses from airlines to small stores are reeling from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s nearly two-month lockdown of India’s 1.3 billion people aimed at limiting the spread of the new coronavirus. Many firms say they won’t survive unless they are bailed out immediately.  The government said on Sunday it would privatize state-run companies in non-strategic sectors and stop fresh insolvency cases for a year.  But apart from that its plans entail a mix of easy loan schemes, a bit more money for a rural job-guarantee program, and a slew of long-awaited policy reforms across sectors that will take effect over the medium-term.  Combined, this is not enough of a boost to prevent a likely 5% contraction in Asia’s third-largest economy in fiscal 2020/2021, Goldman Sachs said on Monday. It said it expected the economy to shrink an eye-watering 45% on an annualized basis in the quarter to the end of June.  Business leaders are unimpressed by the government’s response.  “We are creating all sorts of liquidity for supply, but what about the demand,” said Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, chairperson of Biocon Limited, one of the country’s top health firms.  “Demand is going to play a very big part in economic revival, and if we cannot kick-start demand I fear than we cannot have economic revival. I think we have lost a big opportunity,” she said.  A breakdown of the rescue plan shows that the actual spending of the government is only about a tenth of the $266 billion package, which Modi had hailed as 10% of India’s gross domestic product in line with the big stimulus plans announced by other major economies.  A large part of the rest of the package is actually loans provided by banks, many of them without collateral, leveraging $105 billion of liquidity provided by the central bank, government officials said.  “We would not qualify it as a stimulus package ... Only 1% of GDP is given to compensate for the income loss, which is not likely to be sufficient, “ said Sunil Tirumalai of brokerage Emkay Global.  One percent of GDP would amount to about $29 billion - and the government may well spend even less than that as it fears a sovereign rating downgrade.  GOVT ‘HAS LIMITED RESOURCES’  Two government officials said the government estimates total spending of $27 billion from the budget this year towards the rescue measures, which would prevent the fiscal deficit from widening more than 100 basis points beyond the target of 3.5% of GDP.  The finance ministry must also assess the scale of intervention required if the coronavirus pandemic drags on for longer than currently expected, officials said.  “We do not know how the situation would evolve or how long it will go on for. We need to prepare for that as well, as the government has limited resources and needs to spend wisely,” said one of the officials, who did not want to be named.  Distress is mounting across the economy. Emkay estimated the cost of the lockdown at around $170 billion overall.  Indian airlines are taking an average daily loss of $10 million-$12 million and will need extra funding of 325 billion-350 billion rupees ($4.3 billion-$4.6 billion) in the next two years, according to ratings agency ICRA, a unit of Moody’s.  Airlines have been cutting staff and wages to avoid defaulting on debts to their lessors or banks, even as their fixed costs such as servicing and parking fees keep mounting.  The government has also provided no support to the tourism industry, which is likely to see tens of thousands of job cuts and small firms going bankrupt, the Federation of Associations in Indian Tourism & Hospitality said.  And a fifth of the 70 million retail traders who form the bedrock of Modi’s political support may go under because they are unable to pay wages and rent.  With the lockdown now extended to the end of May, only one thing seems certain: The road back to economic health is going to be long and hard.  “A steep fall in output this year is certain. And we continue to believe that the recovery will be slow,” said Shilan Shah from research firm Capital Economics.  ($1 = 75.7770 Indian rupees)",1
"Days after filing for bankruptcy, J.C. Penney says it plans to close more than a fourth of its stores.  According to a document filed with the Securities and Exchanges Commission on Monday, approximately 29% of the retailer's 846 stores, or 242 locations, will close between the current fiscal year and next fiscal year.  For the current fiscal year, which ends in February, 192 stores are expected to close, and then 50 in the next fiscal year, the document notes. After the closings, the company will have 604 locations.  “The approximately 604 future fleet represent the highest sales-generating, most profitable, and most productive stores in the network,” J.C. Penney said in the SEC filing.  J.C.

Penney careened from one reinvention strategy to another.  The bankruptcy sets in motion the process of permanent store closings as the retailer aims to stabilize its finances and avoid outright liquidation – a fate that chains such as Toys R Us, Payless ShoeSource and others haven't been able to avoid.  A list of which locations will close as part of J.C. Penney's restructuring has not been released.  According to the SEC filing, which outlines a “Plan for Renewal,” the exact number of stores that will remain “continues to evolve.”  J.C.

"Rental car company Hertz has named a new CEO to replace outgoing executive Kathryn Marinello.  Paul Stone, who had served as Hertz's executive vice president and chief retail operations officer, North America, will become CEO and president immediately, the company announced Monday.  Marinello's resignation was reported in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing dated May 15. She will remain with Hertz in a consulting position for up to one year to support a smooth transition, the company says.  ""Having successfully run our largest business segment for the last two years, Paul helped strengthen our brands by elevating service standards across the North American car rental operations."" said Henry R. Keizer, Hertz's chairman, in a statement.  Is it safe to rent a car?:Hertz, rivals enhance cleaning process to eliminate coronavirus  Stock market:Shares rebound as positive Moderna vaccine trial boosts optimism for economic recovery  Prior to joining Hertz in March 2018, Stone, 50, served as senior vice president and chief retail officer at Cabela's. He began his career with Sam's Club and Walmart where he became western U.S. divisional senior vice president.  ""I thank Kathy and look forward to working with my colleagues to do what Hertz people do best – anticipate where transportation, mobility and technology are going and innovate to best serve our customers, stakeholders and communities,"" Stone said in a statement.  Marinello's departure comes about two weeks after Hertz, in a separate SEC filing, said it had begun negotiating with lenders to negotiate ""a financing strategy and structure that better reflects the economic impact"" of COVID-19.  Hertz's action then came amid widespread reports that the company was headed toward a potential bankruptcy filing.  In the May 4 filing, the company said it ""faces significant ongoing operating expenses,"" including agreements that commit the company to leasing more vehicles than it currently needs. Hertz had announced April 14 that it would cut about 10,000 jobs.  Two months ago, when Hertz announced furloughs, Marinello said she would give up 100% of her base salary. According to an SEC filing, Marinello earned more than $8 million in total compensation in 2018. That included a base salary of $1.45 million, which remains the same under a new employment agreement she signed in November.  ""The hardest part about stepping down is leaving the amazing employees that have earned my respect over the last three-and-a-half years. It was an honor to serve them,"" said Marinello. ""I am confident that under Paul's leadership, Hertz will prosper long into the future.",1

"New cases of COVID-19 continued to tick upward in the Bay Area, but the death toll remained static and hospitalization numbers in some areas showed positive trends.  Alameda County added 65 new cases on Monday. That number was only four fewer than the number of new cases added in San Mateo County (69), which issued its first update since Saturday.  Overall, Alameda County has confirmed 2,457 cases of the coronavirus during the pandemic, and it has averaged 51 new cases a day over the past week. It was the fourth time in May that health officials there have confirmed at least 60 new cases in a day.  Oakland, which has confirmed 819 cases and is averaging 187 cases per 100,000 people, is the county’s biggest trouble spot. Hayward is another one, with 495 cases and 307 cases per 100,000 people.  On Monday, Santa Clara County added 19 new cases, bringing its total to 2,470, still the most in the 10-county region. San Francisco’s tally is up to 2,131 after officials there confirmed 40 more cases, and San Mateo County has a total of 1,671. Contra Costa County has tallied 1,155 cases after reporting an additional nine.  Those counties reported their new totals before 6 p.m. Monday and they are reflected through Sunday night.  None of those jurisdictions reported any new deaths, news that is particularly welcome in Alameda County. Health officials there have not reported any deaths for two straight days following a five-day stretch in which they reported at least one death a day and totaled 12.  Santa Clara County has recorded 135 deaths, Alameda County 83, San Mateo County 66, San Francisco 36 and Contra Costa County 33. Solano (16), Marin (14), Sonoma (4), Napa (3) and Santa Cruz (2) counties have combined to record another 39 deaths.  Santa Clara County San Mateo County and San Francisco have not added to their death totals for three straight days, and Contra Costa County hasn’t added a new death since Wednesday. There have been two deaths in the past week in San Francisco and 10 in San Mateo County, compared to six and five, respectively, the week prior.  Contra Costa County has added fewer than 10 cases in a day three times over the past week.  Health officials in Contra Costa County also reported that only 16 people were in the hospital with the coronavirus, equaling the fewest that have been there since only 15 were hospitalized on March 24. Over the past seven days, an average of 18 people per day have been in the hospital in Contra Costa County; on April 14, the seven-day average was 39.  Although more results are expected to be added, the initial 294 tests to come back Sunday in San Francisco showed the highest positive percentage in the city (9%) since April 22.  Hospitalizations in the city dropped even further entering the weekend. The number fell to a new low Friday, down 17% from the day before, which was already the lowest it had been since March 31. There was one more patient hospitalized Saturday, for 53 at last count, but two fewer in intensive care units. ICU patients are now at their lowest levels since the city began tracking the data at the end of March.  Of the 69 newly reported cases in San Mateo County, 47 came Saturday and nine Sunday, with the remainder attributed to tests taken before the weekend, according to the county’s dashboard.  Hospitalizations in San Mateo County had fallen to a new low late last week before rising back up slightly over the weekend. The 54 patients hospitalized there Saturday were 10 more than Thursday, but still lower than at anytime before the past week since the virus took hold.  Statewide, the number of cases topped 80,000 on Sunday, with just over 10,000 in the Bay Area. With all Bay Area jurisdictions modifying their local orders, only Los Angeles and Sacramento counties remain in Phase 1 of Gov. Gavin Newsom’s reopening plan.

"Professor Neil Ferguson, who led the COVID-19 modeling team at Imperial College in London, resigned May 5 from his government advisory role after breaking the very same British lockdown rules that he had a role in influencing.  Ferguson led the Imperial College team that designed the computer model that, among others, had been used to justify the recent stay-at-home orders in England as well as in the United States. We now know the model was so highly flawed it never should have been relied upon for policy decisions to begin with.  Epidemiology—the study of the incidence, prevalence, and impact of disease—frequently calls upon models to forecast potential outcomes of diseases. Not surprisingly, once COVID-19 became a pandemic, policy experts from all across the world began relying on such models.  LISTEN TO DR. DAYARATNA SPEAK ABOUT THIS ON HEARTLAND’S PODCAST  ﻿  The Imperial College researchers ran one such model they had used in prior research and forecast a number of potential outcomes, including that, by October, more than 500,000 people in Great Britain and 2 million people in the U.S. would die as a result of COVID-19.  The model also predicted the United States could incur up to 1 million deaths even with “enhanced social distancing” guidelines, including “shielding the elderly.” Imperial’s modeling results influenced British Prime Minister Boris Johnson to impose a nationwide lockdown and influenced the White House as well.  I asked Ferguson and his colleagues for their model on multiple occasions to see how they got their numbers, but they never replied to my emails.  According to Nature, they had been “working with Microsoft to tidy up the code and make it available.” I also asked the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the codes it used to develop its COVID-19 forecasts, but got no response.  So, my colleague Norbert Michel and I decided to take a publicly available COVID-19 epidemiological model and forecast the prevalence and mortality of the disease under a variety of plausible scenarios.  The results varied, depending on the assumptions we made about mortality rates within hospital intensive care units, asymptomatic rates, and the specification of the R0 (pronounced R-naught) value, which measures how easily the virus spreads.  We found mortality rate predictions can be quite variable depending on the age and comorbidities of those contracting the virus.  Under varying assumptions regarding a mortality rate in intensive care units between 5% and 30%, we found that predicted mortality because of the disease could range from near 78,000 deaths to as many as 810,000 deaths in the U.S. by Aug. 1.  Recent testing data indicates that the asymptomatic rate for COVID-19 is likely not trivial, and data from Iceland indicates this rate can be as high as 50%. Assuming an asymptomatic rate ranging from 15% to 55%, one can project deaths in the U.S. of between 118,000 and 394,000 by Aug. 1.  Lastly, we looked at the model’s assumption about the virus’ basic reproductive number, the aforementioned R0 value. Popularized in the 2011 movie “Contagion,” the R0 value quantifies the average number of people who will get the virus from someone who is an infected.  Under assumptions of the R0 value ranging from 1.5 to 3.5—plausible estimates based on medical research as discussed in our paper—the model predicted from 44,000 dead to 1.1 million dead by Aug. 1 in the U.S.  According to the Johns Hopkins University coronavirus tracker, we are currently over 83,000 deaths, which exceeds our lower-end estimates. But the point our research made is that these types of models produce many plausible scenarios, depending on reasonable assumptions.  As we learn more about the new coronavirus, it is imperative to continue to update the assumptions used in these models.  After we had published our work, news surfaced that Microsoft had actually made some headway in making the Imperial College team’s model available. But the codes it released are a highly modified version of what the Imperial team actually used.  And, it turns out, the model has serious flaws, which a former software engineer from Google discusses at length in his blog.  The Imperial College code provides different answers using the same inputs. In particular, the same assumptions can provide results that differ by 80,000 deaths over a span of 80 days. The software engineer has noted there are apparently myriad other problems as well—including undocumented codes and numerous bugs.  This isn’t the first time bad models have made their way into policy. As we discussed in our work, statistical models can be useful tools for guiding policy, but they are only as credible as the assumptions on which they are based.  It is fundamentally important for models used in policy to be made publicly available, have assumptions clearly stated, and have their robustness to changes to these assumptions tested. Models also need to be updated as time goes on in line with the best available evidence.  Bottom line: The Imperial College model didn’t meet any of these criteria. And sadly, its model was one of the inputs relied on as the basis for locking down two countries.  The codes we used at The Heritage Foundation are available here. Our assumptions are clearly stated in our paper here.",0

This comes as ""Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday pledged $2 billion to the WHO to tackle the coronavirus pandemic and said he supported a 'global review' of the international response to the outbreak, but only if it is led by the WHO and only after the virus has been contained,"" Fox News reported Monday. What are we to make of this?  As Trump continues the removal of various inspectors general, ""the firing of State Department IG Steve Linick might be the most problematic,"" the Washington Post's Aaron Blake wrote in a Tuesday analysis. ""Linick, we've come to find out, had been investigating Secretary of State Mike Pompeo personally, as well as a major decision Pompeo had approved on an arms deal with Saudi Arabia. Both the White House and Pompeo have said the removal of Linick was Pompeo’s call."" Why is this problematic?  ""US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has threatened that Washington will 'exact consequences' if the International Criminal Court (ICC) moves ahead with a potential war crimes investigation into Israel,"" PressTV reported Sunday. In response to this, ""a bipartisan group of US House and Senate legislators sent separate letters to Pompeo urging him to defend Israel, a firm US ally, against ICC investigations, saying the tribunal's assertion amounted to a 'politicization' of the court's mission,"" PressTV continued.  Is it true that a ""disinformation campaign aimed to justify the assassination of Qassem Soleimani by painting him and Iran as willing enablers of al-Qaeda,"" as The Grayzone reported Tuesday? According to the outlet, the propaganda operation relied heavily on a shoddily sourced book entitled “The Exile."" What's really going on here?

"Sara Potler LaHayne  Opinion contributor  Whether or not we’re willing to admit it, nearly all of us are experiencing a form of trauma because of the coronavirus pandemic. Uncertainty, stress and anxiety are running high.  A recent Common Sense Media and Survey Monkey report found that 61% of teens surveyed reported feeling worried about themselves (or someone in their family) getting sick; 63% reported feeling worried about their family’s ability to make a living; and 42% reported feeling more lonely than usual.  Many parents have lost work and are struggling to provide for their families’ basic needs. Other parents are attempting to work full-time while also caring for their children and overseeing their remote learning. We are grieving the loss of the lives we once knew.  For students, not being able to see friends, participate in regularly scheduled activities or engage in their normal routines is incredibly disruptive. And we, as parents, are learning just how hard it is to get our kids to focus when they’re emotionally distant or distracted — a task even more difficult for educators.  With schools across the country closed, districts acknowledge that student learning capacity is taking a hit. While we’re more forgiving about the number of academic hours logged, school districts can step up in other ways now and when we prepare to return: by supporting students’ social and emotional wellness.  Students need social and emotional support, and this cannot just be the job of therapists and mental health professionals, especially when schools already face a shortage of psychologists and counselors. The current 430-to-1 ratio of students to counselors in the U.S. falls far short of the American School Counselor Association recommendation of 250-to-1.

Teachers, whether they’re working in buildings or remotely, may interact with their students more regularly than anyone else. They need the tools to be able to proactively check in with students’ feelings and practice social emotional skills that will help students cope through the pandemic and beyond.  Beginning classes with a quick check in can go a long way. Asking students to share how they are feeling, a challenge they are facing, or a hope they have for the week can help educators gauge what burdens students are carrying. Every student might not have the words or vocabulary, so using facial expressions or creative modes such as drawing or poetry can bridge the gap. Guiding these conversations can feel tricky and maybe even uncomfortable at first, which is why teachers need a structured framework.  Some people argue that these skills should be practiced in the home, and not in the school. But we’re now in a position where school is in the home. We have a huge opportunity to distribute virtual social and emotional learning tools across the country to support our students, teachers and school communities through this pandemic and beyond.  Stress affects ability to learn  The fact is, our children’s stressors and their inability to properly manage their emotions prevent them from being effective learners. Much like you wouldn’t expect to run a marathon without fueling your body, we cannot expect students to learn without strengthening their minds and their hearts. With studies that show extreme stress can disrupt the architecture of a growing brain, grades don’t matter so much now.  With the emphasis on remote instruction and thinking through what school will look like when we return to “normal,” I urge districts and policy makers to invest in the healing and rebuilding of our whole selves that’s required for us to function at the highest level.  To do this right, we need to teach skills such as emotional identification, expression and management alongside foundational relationship skills and problem-solving strategies. When we provide this foundation for all students, we cultivate a more supportive learning environment and can better understand which students need additional support.  Help students process emotions  COVID-19 will leave a lasting mark. We’re going to need support to heal and grow in its aftermath. While states are re-opening and discussing how to eventually go back to school, most of the focus is on physical safety — masks, temperature checks, extra hand sanitizer, maintaining distancing. But how will your first-grader feel when they can no longer see the smile behind their teacher’s mask, exchange a high five to celebrate a job well done, or receive a hug when they seek a moment of comfort? How will they learn if they’re afraid?  Social emotional learning supports will be essential in helping students process the feelings and emotions that have surfaced as a result of living through a pandemic. Those same supports will help build a foundation for students to express themselves in healthy ways so they can learn and grow for the rest of their lives.

"Like all big tech companies, Google and Alphabet are playing an outsized role in our lives as the coronavirus pandemic continues. Whether it’s helping people find reliable information in search, working with the government on testing, building an exposure-tracking system into Android and iOS in partnership with Apple, or battling misinformation on YouTube, Google’s capability — and responsibility — has never been greater.  Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai recently joined The Vergecast to talk about the challenges Google faces during this time, including a shift in its core ad business and the challenges of managing the company remotely. Pichai is himself adapting to remote work; he’s actively blocking out more time on his calendar to read and think, something he used to do during his commute. And he’s learning to make pizza from scratch by watching YouTube videos.  “It came out okay,” he said.  Pichai also talked about Google’s commitment to its hardware business, including the Pixel phone line, and how the company is continuing to try to simplify its famously complex messaging app strategy.  “The irony of the Google Meet team working remotely to make and iterate the product to get it to where they wanted it to be was very interesting to see,” said Pichai.  You can listen to the full interview below, in the podcast player of your choice, or scroll down to read a full transcript, lightly edited for clarity.  Nilay Patel: There’s three things I really want to talk about. One, how Google is handling the pandemic. Two, how your business is being impacted. And three, I talk to every CEO about how they manage their time, and I’m confident that managing a company the size of Google remotely has changed that.  I want to talk about all that stuff. But there were two big stories about Google that are important [from last week]. I want to ask two questions about them right away. First, there’s a big NBC piece from April Glaser suggesting that your diversity efforts have been wound down [and] that the company is not even using the word “diversity” internally anymore. Is that true?  Sundar Pichai: Diversity is a foundational value for us. Given the scale at which we build products and the fact we do it locally for our users, we are deeply committed to having that representation in our workforce. I think we were one of the earliest companies to publish transparency reports, and we’ve shared that ever since. And we just released our recent annual diversity report. We’ve made modest progress in critical areas. There’s a long ways to go. But it is really important.  What we are doing in the company is constantly at our scale. We look at that first — see what works, what we can scale up better. All I can say is we probably have more resources invested in diversity now than at any point in our history as a company, in terms of the scale and the resources we put in.  NP: There’s part of that report, which is interesting to talk about, because we hear about it in regards to Facebook a lot, but I don’t know if we’ve ever really asked anybody at Google about it. It’s that criticism from the conservative side of the aisle is something you’re more responsive to with these initiatives, with how you’re running the company. Is that something you think about, in terms of who’s criticizing you from where?  Our diversity efforts, we don’t bring any such lens to it. There are many areas where we are still, as an industry, as a company, dramatically underrepresented. So there’s a long way for us to go. And we’ve just not had that consideration. I think, independently, just within the company, we have definitely made efforts to make sure the company can accommodate viewpoints, and no one feels they’re not part of the company, regardless of their political viewpoints, amongst other things. But that’s about it. I think these are two independent things.  Dieter Bohn: So the other big story that hit yesterday, from the day we’re recording, was over at The Information, about Mario Queiroz and Marc Levoy quietly leaving the Pixel division, and the Pixel sales numbers maybe not being super great. Is the Pixel business living up to where you hoped it would be right now?  I’ll comment on hardware, and then talk about Pixel, too.  The last couple of years have been a major integration phase for us because we’ve combined our Google hardware efforts with Nest. We absorbed the mobile division of HTC. So it’s been a lot of stitching together. And we have a wide product portfolio, too. So it’s definitely been a building phase. We’re super committed to it for the long run. Hardware is hard. And it definitely has components, which take real time to get it right, thinking about underlying silicon or display or camera or any of those tacks. And so we are definitely investing in it, but that timeline. I think we’ve made a lot of progress.  “Hardware is hard.”  Pixel 3A last year was one of our highest NPS-rated products ever, and definitely even benchmarked outside. So to me, it’s a clear indication we have made a lot of progress. We just launched Pixel Buds this week, which you guys covered — thank you — to a good reception. Our Nest Home Hub products are definitely doing well.  We take a long-term view. We are not in it just for phones alone. We have a vision of where computing needs to go. And I think it’s really hard to drive that vision without doing hardware, software, and services together. You have to think of the intersection of it. I see a lot of value in thinking about it and doing it that way.  We are definitely going to have hiccups. We are a nascent player in a really complex space, so not everything’s going to be smooth. But am I excited about our portfolio for later this year — especially if I take a longer-term view? Because some of the deeper efforts we are putting in will take three to four years to actually play out. And when they come in, I think I’m excited about how they will shape where we are going.  DB: Yeah. I’ve asked you “How serious are you about hardware?” every year since you created the division, and sort of like with self-driving cars it’s, “Well, it’ll be a five-year timeframe, it’ll be a five-year timeframe.” That five-year timeframe always seems to be five years out.  So when you say you’re in it for the long term, is that still the timeframe that you’re thinking of for [hardware] really bringing back really serious results in terms of big sales numbers or big influence in the market or are you looking for something more immediate?  No, I mean we think about our hardware efforts obviously in the context of our overall computing efforts and in addition to what our ecosystem is doing. So we take that into account. I do think it’s important we build a sustainable business, financially, too. Because I look at the level of investment hardware needs, both in terms of all the technology R&D you need to do, the kind of supply chain you need to develop, as well as the go-to-market investments you need. So it’s a deep investment. So to do it well, I think you have to do it with a clear financial sustainability goal. So that’s important.  So for me, three reasons. One is to drive computing forward. The second is we really guide our ecosystem. Pretty much everything we’ve done well, you can go all the way back and Android’s early days, Samsung Galaxy Nexus, which we worked together, was a pivotal phone. Nexus 7 in the tablet world. I can point to Chromebooks — all along, we did our original hardware to kind of bootstrap it. And I look at areas maybe where we haven’t done opinionated [work] — maybe [smart]watch is a good example where we haven’t. And then you can see it’s tough to guide an ecosystem to what your vision of it is, just building the underlying platform.  So I think that’s the second reason. And third is to really build a sustainable hardware business. I think all of it is important, and that’s how I think about it. And I’m excited. Rick [Osterloh] and team, working closely with Hiroshi [Lockheimer] and team, they have that long-term view. So we’re pretty committed to it.  Listen to The Vergecast, the only podcast you need to make sense of this week’s tech news, hosted by Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn. Subscribe here!  DB: So you’re the CEO of Alphabet now, in addition to Google. How much of your time do you actually even get to devote to hardware? Are you looking at prototypes? Is it just sort of one meeting in a week? Or is it a larger part of your time?  It’s just a coincidence, I think, I spent my morning with the team today talking about our portfolio for next year.  DB: Anything you want to tell us?  You guys are going to figure it out anyway!  It’s a good question. Rick and Hiroshi drive these efforts. But I try to spend time in a more stepped-back way on some of the bigger things they are doing over time.  NP: Dieter is pointing out — he just reviewed the Galaxy... A51?  DB: That’s right.  NP: That’s a cheap phone. He gave it a seven. The reason we reviewed it—  I saw the intro to the video where you said, “This phone sells more than the Galaxy.” I actually watched the video.  DB: It actually was the top-selling phone last quarter worldwide.  I think I learned it from watching your video. It was just kind of interesting. Maybe I should have known that.  NP: That’s the question here. When we think about your phones coming out, we think about are you competitive with the flagship Samsung devices? We think, are you competitive with the iPhones? But the bulk of the market is down there, at $399, $499. Is that where you want to be? Or do you want to go make a big flagship phone and take share away from the top of the market?  The area where we have demonstrated the strongest value proposition, that’s why I gave the [Pixel] 3A example, it’s where we clearly have demonstrated it. But having said that, if you want to drive computing forward, that high end is where you’re going to also keep moving the needle. And it’s where we are putting a lot of our effort into.  So you will continue to see us invest in both ends of the spectrum. We care all the way — [we’re] obviously working with our ecosystem [on] entry-level devices. I’m deeply passionate about that. But definitely, the high end is something where we’re putting in a lot of effort. That’s where some of the underlying investments pay. It accumulates over time because it takes two to three years to do some of the deeper investments you need to do it really well.  DB: Are you seeing — especially now with everyone at home — are you seeing big changes in consumer behavior in terms of buying hardware? Is everyone going out and buying Nest cameras? Or they feel that they don’t need them because they’re at home anyway? Anything changing for you there?  Obviously, on the software side, we have clearly seen impact in terms of usage across several of our products. Some products have been negatively affected, too. But we can clearly measure it. Hardware is a bit more complex because it’s really gated by the supply chain, [which] got affected for different products in different ways, and demand has definitely been affected, too. Some of it is to do with lack of retail working well and all that stuff. So I think it is tough to exactly forecast what demand will come back. So for me, it’s too early to tell.  NP: Let’s skip into the broader business of Google and how it’s going. Dieter had the question about consumer behavior. I just had this guess, so I’m going to ask you: is Maps usage way down?  Yeah, totally. [Laughs] You alone not using it is probably contributing. No, I’m just kidding.  NP: I’m always using it.  No, it did have a significant — obviously, as people aren’t driving around, you clearly saw an impact. Interesting to me, was maybe over the last two to three weeks, we definitely see users coming back to it looking for local information. So definitely we see activity back around people trying to find services, what’s around, what’s open. People are exploring and discovering local services again. So there’s this clear inflection, but not clear what that fully means. But that’s where it is.  NP: And then in your broader business — obviously Google makes the bulk of its revenue in advertising. We have felt the effects of the advertising market changing. The whole world has felt the effects of the advertising market changing. How are you seeing those effects at Google? What are you doing to manage against them?  I spoke about it in the earnings call. Compared to January and February, we clearly saw the impact in March. So for sure, Google is not immune to the global economy. In some ways, it’s representative across all sectors. So clearly, as entire sectors have been affected — travel being a particularly severe example of it — we have definitely felt that across the board.  “Google is not immune to the global economy.”  What’s interesting for us is, historically, compared to past cycles, search is something that is very highly ROI-driven, performance-oriented. And so advertisers adapt. They pull back quickly. We see demand shifts and people capitalizing on it. You will see activity in “office furniture” instantly, right then. So you can kind of see the economy adapt in real time. And so it’s fascinating to see it that way. But for sure, it’s definitely impacted our business.  DB: In your earnings call, you hinted that this wasn’t going to turn around right away next quarter. We’re in for a tough time for a while. But coming out of this in however long it takes, do you think that the ad market is going to look substantially similar to what it looked like a year ago? Or are you thinking that things are going to fundamentally change in your ad business, or in your business generally, in a way that you’re able to look at now? Or is it just way too early to tell? It’s too hard to forecast?  It’s the question, which is on a lot of our minds: What are the trends you are seeing which have reverted back to the mean? And what is it that is here to stay? Well, will travel ever return to what it was before? And so on.  It’s obviously tough to predict with the nature of the virus, how long it’ll be. We generally assume the effects will be there for a while. I think that’s the right way to think about it. As a company, we assume that it’s going to take a while to recover, and [we’re] planning for it that way. But it’s a bit hard for me to say.  Human needs are pretty fundamental, I think, in terms of being social, wanting to meet people. Personally, I can’t wait to be back in a... I wish I could go watch a football game or something.  Would I like to go to a music concert? The answer is yes. So I think the innate human need is there. But I think it’ll be a while before we get back to it. So I expect it to be kind of a slow, steady recovery.  NP: How are you thinking about the general push to reopen? At Google, you said people are going to work from home through 2020. What are you thinking about for Google? And then broadly, how are you thinking about this push to reopen, particularly in the United States?  Early on, I felt we were one of the first to go to work from home, partly because I think it made sense for the health and safety of our employees. I felt that, given a lot of our work could be done from home, it made sense for us to contribute to social distancing. Clearly, the needs vary widely across different groups. We talked about hardware earlier — definitely having access to testing equipment, labs, it’s really important. You can’t test whether something works in 5G unless you can actually be in that testing environment.  So it varies widely across teams. And we are going to be conservative on the return back for the broad company. When the local ordinance allows, I think we’ll probably start with trying to get 10 to 15 percent of the company back, prioritizing people who actually kind of need to be there. And that way, we can really have a de-densified environment and have a lot of safety procedures in place. And just because we are talking about 10 to 15 percent capacity doesn’t mean that many people — we can rotate and actually get more people in once or twice a week.  “A vast majority of employees we think will likely work from home through the end of the year.”  And you have people in two different buckets. There are people who really want to come back, and they miss it. Especially at Google, for 20 years, we have genuinely invested in our physical spaces and the culture it creates with a view to having people work well together. And so I think there are people who miss that part of the experience, depending on what your personal situation is. And then there are people on the other side of the spectrum who want to be conservative. So we are trying to make that play out.  But I expect by the end of the year, we’ll be at 20 to 30 percent capacity. Which may still mean we are able to get 60 percent of our employees in once a week, or something like that. And so that’s what we mean, where a vast majority of employees we think will likely work from home through the end of the year. But it’s a very fluid situation. If things, of course, look better, we will adapt to it. We want to be flexible. Trying to really understand what works, what doesn’t work in this.  DB: Are you thinking longer term in terms of the number of people that might work from home or work remotely? Twitter just announced forever. You can work from home for as long as you want. Are you thinking in that way, too? Or are you going to wait and see how things play out?  I want to be driven by data here, and so I view it as a research phase, and [we’ll] see where the data leads us. In some ways, I’m glad Twitter is running a kind of one-end-of-the-spectrum experiment. So thanks, Jack. It’s good to see that end of the spectrum.  Productivity is down in certain parts, and what is not clear to me is — in the first two months, most of the people are already on projects in which they kind of know what they need to do. But the next phase, which will kick in is, let’s say you’re designing next year’s products, and you’re in a brainstorming phase, and things are more unstructured. How does that collaboration actually work? That’s a bit hard to understand and do. So we are trying to understand what works well and what doesn’t.  We’re probably going to be conservative in it. We want to make sure things work well. But coming out of it all, do we all learn and have more flexibility in how we think about this? I think so, yeah. That’s how I would bet.  NP: I’m going to take this moment to somehow transition and ask you about messaging strategy. I’m going to figure it out. You just come with me as we do it.  [Laughs] How can I do a Verge podcast without thinking about our—  DB: Pop quiz, hotshot. Name all the products.  Our entire complexity in messaging is to make sure Verge has plenty of material to work with.  NP: Google has historically been good at dogfooding and using its own products. Obviously, this is a moment to use these products in a way that maybe had never been stressed before. You added gallery view to Meet. That seems like a button that should have been there, and suddenly everybody realized it’s not there, and snap, it’s there.  But there are some bigger competitors. There’s more consumer-focused companies that are succeeding, like Zoom. Is this a moment of clarity for you? To say, “We actually have to win this. We know what we need to do because we’re using our own products as much as we are.”  It’s definitely an important moment. We brought Javier [Soltero] in a few months ago, before all this, with a clear view. So we had a clear sense of where we wanted to go, so some of the efforts were clearly underway, and in some ways, when COVID hit, we weren’t fully done with all the changes we had wanted to make.  I think the irony of the Google Meet team working remotely to make and iterate the product to get it to where they wanted it to be was very interesting to see. Javier has a very, very long commute, and one of his biggest concerns was the commute when he was joining. He’s doing it all virtually now. But it is an important moment. Many schools, many organizations already use Google Meet. So we are doubling down.  “RCS is where we are like United Nations. We try to herd a bunch of people.”  Obviously, COVID has blurred the lines between consumer and enterprise, and people are using products in all kinds of contexts. And so definitely, we are using it as an opportunity to make Google Meet and Google Chat, scale it up and make it more available.  And obviously, we are a service provider [but] we are a platform, too. Hence RCS and all the work we are doing. RCS is where we are like United Nations. We try to herd a bunch of people. So it’s making better progress than it appears because you’re collecting so many people together on it. As people sign up, you will see more and more momentum.  So all of that is coming together well, I think. I’m glad we realigned it, everything with Javier. He works both with our cloud team with Thomas [Kurian], and our platforms team with Hiroshi. And so I think we’ll get to the right place. I’m very excited.  DB: You brought up RCS. You know I’m going to ask. What are the—  This is a rare moment where I am like... because I know Dieter wants to talk about it. So I had to go there.  DB: In an age when Facebook is saying, “We are going to integrate all of our messaging products, and we’re going to put everything under full end-to-end encryption,” do you think that Google having multiple products in multiple contexts is still the way to go? Or do you think there needs to be more integration there?  We definitely want to have a more integrated, simplified view, but in all scenarios, I see our platform offering. Android is open as part of the open platform stack. I think you need an open standard messaging framework. And we have to evolve that from its SMS days, and that’s RCS for me.  And obviously, we’ll continue doing that in all scenarios because I think that’s part of building that open stack. I don’t see that changing. But in terms of our services, I want it to be as simplified for people as possible. And I think we’ve made great strides compared to where we were with Google Meet and Chat. Of course, we have Duo. We intended Duo for consumers and Google Meet and Chat for businesses, effectively. But the lines have blurred. And they share a lot of common underlying technology. They’re both built on WebRTC, and so there’s a lot of common work, and given its common teams, hopefully we can iterate.  But some flexibility, I think it’s fine here.  NP: We started out by talking about phones. One of the reasons Apple’s phones are so sticky is they have a great messaging product. Do you think that that is connected? You need a great sticky messaging product to move people over?  Let me give a user answer and a technical answer, too.  From a user standpoint, any Android phone you get, you always want a phone number-based messaging product, which you’re going to create, and you want something which comes with the platform, and we’re trying to align that. And that integration, I think is critical. And so I do feel it’s an important part and where Android has been behind. So I think it’s important there.  Technically, different OEMs and different carriers having different RCS implementations was one of the biggest causes of fragmentation in Android. It caused real pain. So simplifying that is a tremendous multiplier in terms of productivity and efficiency and simplicity. And so for both reasons, I think, it’s important to invest, and get it right.  NP: So we lured you here by saying we were going to talk about the pandemic. We’ve mostly talked about messaging. I want to make sure we talk about the pandemic.  [Laughs] What a surprise.  NP: I feel like your team prepped you well. You had to know this question was coming. I keep track every week of when Trump and his team held up the flowchart and said, “Some x thousand Google engineers are working on it.”  Just walk me through that day. Did you expect that to come? The next day, Trump said someone from Google had called and apologized to him. Did that happen? Just what was that set of days like?  Very early on through COVID, we decided as a company we should do everything [in] areas where our expertise could help. And so we had a wide set of efforts.  I think there were two efforts, and we were in touch with the [White House] coronavirus task force. And there were two efforts, both in terms of what Google can do to provide more information, and Verily was working on a way to develop wide-scale testing, particularly with an emphasis on drive-through testing, with a focus on first responders. And we were in touch on both efforts. And so that’s what it was.  Today, I think Verily right now is in 86 sites across 13 states. And that’s what that effort was. It’s obviously taken more time than most of us expected to get there, but there were real constraints along the way. But I think we’ve made a lot of progress. My view on this is, at a time of global pandemic, we want to do everything we can to help the US government succeed. And so we’re trying to play our role in it.  NP: I’m just going to ask you directly: did you call President Trump and apologize?  My discussions were with the task force, so that’s who I was talking to.  NP: It’s quite a quote. It just struck me at that time that the distinction between Google and Verily was not being well-made. And so I think my follow-up here is: is that clearer now? You’re the CEO of Alphabet. Verily is under Alphabet. You’re also the head of Google.  I think we were communicating across two areas. We were communicating both. I do feel like the onus is on us as a company to clarify and be clear in terms of how we are communicating. I don’t think we got everything right in terms of communicating across the two groups, which were talking back and forth. So I just wanted to make sure we were clear in terms of how we were communicating.  NP: So what now is the relationship between Verily and Google? Do you still have volunteers working at the Verily project?  Yes. Because they’re both under Alphabet, we view it as areas where we help. So sometimes Google is doing work on health care, Verily is doing health care. If we share resources where we need to, sometimes there could be an AI breakthrough from Google, which is what Verily uses to commercialize. But at a technical level, we can exchange ideas. At a regulatory level, we work together to have a compliance process, and all that framework we built in. But I’m excited at the progress Verily is making as well.  DB: Do you find that separation, as sort of two separate companies under one umbrella, it’s still useful? Or has your thinking changed about the distinction between Alphabet company Verily and Alphabet company Google?  It’s a good question. There are many areas where I find the distinction to actually help because when you take something like Waymo, and the timeframe it needs to operate in, [it’s] dealing with a very different set of issues than building a typical internet product. I like the fact that there’s structural separation, that the Google management team doesn’t have to sit and think through that breadth, and they can be more focused. And it allows us to play these different bets with the different characteristics they would need and different time horizons and so on.  So Alphabet creates that flexibility. The underlying commonality across all of Alphabet is we think [there] has to be a deeper technology play — something based on some foundational technology to solve something. That’s the underlying commonality.  Google is broadly focused on the internet space, and you know if [a problem] is distinctly different from that, and allows us to still apply the technology — maybe share common things like AI and our data centers but have the right structure, right incentives, right approach to go tackle that problem. And so I think it’s been really helpful to have that flexibility. I would expect sometimes we may look at something and say, “Hey, it’s in Google. Maybe it makes sense to be more in Alphabet” or vice versa. We created that structure to create that flexibility. Nest is a good example. It made more sense that it’s aligned closer with the hardware team, and obviously, there’s convergence there.  NP: So there’s a couple big health initiatives inside the Alphabet umbrella. Verily is one of them. This is a moment, I think, for biotech, for health sciences. Would you say Verily is entirely now focused on COVID and the pandemic? Or is it one of many things it’s doing?  It’s one of many things. There are a lot of folks there who are doctors and health care people. Obviously, by calling, they feel motivated to help at a moment like that. So there is a lot of focus. But they’re focused on areas like diabetes, a longer-term disease. So they’re clearly focused on other aspects of health care as well, and they will continue doing that. And so those are big doubled-up efforts already underway.  NP: Google is doing a bunch of other stuff around the coronavirus and COVID-19. What are some of those other things outside of the website?  It’s a big part. By now, we’ve committed over a billion dollars in various ways, be it grants to public health organizations, ad credits to small / medium businesses, and then working in each country through the official agencies’ direct loan programs to small / medium businesses as well. We have undertaken efforts on PPE. There’s the deep work we have done on ventilators out of Rick’s team. And obviously, our support for schools through products like Meet. We have provided Chromebooks. So it spans a wide variety of effort.  And obviously, exposure notification, and the work in the contact tracing has a big effort, jointly with Apple as well.  NP: Is it not often that Google and Apple collaborate at this level. How did that come about? What was your conversation with Tim Cook like? How’s it going in terms of the two companies working together?  It’s been a really terrific effort. It started, I think both of us saw the problem and saw the opportunity to do something, and the teams had started working on it. And at the right point, you realize in this problem, particularly to do it well, we saw some of the earlier app efforts actually struggling to work well.  And so we realized as platform providers, we really want to make it easy, and to make it work at scale, obviously with user consent and privacy protection. And the teams started talking, they saw an opportunity to do it better, so Tim and I connected, and we talked, and we said, “Let’s announce it jointly.” That helps clarify that we are going to approach it consistently.  And so for public health organizations planning, we wanted to give a clear commitment and a framework that they can actually invest, and we’re going to support it as a platform.  The teams talk multiple times a week across the two companies, and we are in conversations with public health organizations around the world. You will see there are large countries where they are fully developing a service on top of it. Our goal here is to have one more toolkit in all the efforts you need to manage COVID. We wanted to make sure we created the option value and add one more step in that toolkit.  NP: When you’re on the phone with Tim Cook, what was a problem that needed the two of you to solve or decision that needed the two of you to make?  One example I would give, when Tim and I talked, it was mainly actually deciding to just go public and lay it all out, earlier than both companies would normally do in a process like this.  We would have probably normally waited to develop, hash out more issues fully. But we both realized, given the public nature of it, given the responsible conversation you need to have with many societal institutions as part of it, it was important that we put it out and shared details, and engaged in a conversation. So we basically made that decision, I think teams had maybe different timelines on when they should be announced. And so we talked through, and we decided to announce it sooner rather than later.  DB: You and I have talked previously about Google’s responsibility when it comes to AI and making sure AI was ethical. With this, you’re in the middle of a pandemic, you’re in the middle of a whole bunch of different countries with their own health organizations. How do you think about your responsibility as the CEO of Google in this pandemic? Because from a certain perspective, it rises to a governmental level of a social contract with users. Or you could say, “No, no. We’re just a tech company.” So how do you see that?  It’s a good question. It’s a one in 100-year kind of issue we are dealing with. So it’s important. I want to do everything we can [and] always be aware that we are a company, a private company, working through an extraordinarily public moment. We clearly have products, which people come and rely on, and so doing that well, both in terms of providing high-quality information and getting it right trumps everything as we handle that. And that is the biggest way by which we can do well.  Beyond that, supporting our employees, supporting the communities we operate in, all that goes hand in hand. And then there are longer-term efforts where, because we have deep technological underpinnings, we can bring that technology to bear to support health care organizations and so on. But that’s the way I think about it.  I think it’s an important moment where the big companies need to step up. But I think you need to do it in a construct in which you realize you’re a private company, and you’re one small part of big value chain to solve this.  NP: So that’s an interesting way of putting it because some of the problems you’re solving are new. We’re going to use the Bluetooth radios in everybody’s cellphone to do exposure notification. I think, historically, that’s a new idea. I don’t think people had that before. It’s obviously got a bunch of new problems to solve.  On the flip side, there are some very old problems to solve here. Are people getting reliable information? Can they trust their leaders? Can they trust the companies they rely on? Google obviously provides a lot of information in search. You provide a lot of information in YouTube.  There have been some massive coordinated disinformation campaigns on both of those platforms. Facebook just recently announced what amounts to a worldwide supreme court for free speech on its platform. Are you thinking you need to do something at that scale to manage the very old problems of reliable information on your platforms?  It’s the foundation of what our company is built on. Search was designed across the web to surface the highest-quality information. So it’s something we’ve thought about for a long time. Obviously, the challenges have gotten more complex and harder, for sure. And so we have evolved our approaches, too.  I’m following what everybody is doing with a lot of interest here. So for example, in YouTube, over the past maybe four years, we have definitely, for categories of information, relied on external experts. On violent extremism, we partner with counter-extremism organizations. So we tap their expertise to help shape our policies. And as we evolved our hate and harassment policies last year, we consulted many organizations. We took inputs.  So I think relying on deep experts, other nonprofit institutions, governmental expertise, is a natural way we want to approach our work. And so I think to me, whether you set up an oversight board — I will look to see what the learnings from it are, and definitely going to study that. I think it’s important to understand that.  I think we are going to be flexible. If we find something works, we will be really open to adopting it. But we also, I think directionally, have really worked hard to bring outside input in terms of policy definition and so on. So that’s how we generally think about it.  NP: I want to just ask about how you are managing Google. Vergecast listeners know I tend to end all these interviews by saying, “How do you manage your time?” And that question, it used to have one kind of very clear set of answers. Now, it’s all different. So as CEO of Google, you’re obviously managing a giant company remotely. You’re dealing with governments. You’re dealing with your own employees. How are you currently just managing your time operating the company?  I’ve tried to have two parallel tracks. One is explicitly, there’s a definite focus on COVID response. So I’m spending a significant chunk of my time on something like that, which I wasn’t spending two months ago.  But also making sure the company operationally is focused on continuing to pursue all efforts they are doing and being able to compartmentalize, and do that, too. And so I’m making sure that our meetings just have a real sense of normalcy, and that’s why I gave the example of the earlier morning meeting today when I was reviewing our product plan for next year. It’s just a normal meeting, which I would have done. And so being able to do—  NP: What surprised you in that meeting?  It is just — timelines are hard to plan around. Your disruptions are kind of concerning. So when you plan timelines — and they’re for sure hard — it’s not a surprise. It’s what was different about the meeting.  NP: I almost got you. I was this close.  [Laughs] Almost. That’s why I’m laughing.  NP: So you’re having meetings on sort of a normal cadence with a sense of normalcy. What else has shifted for you in how you’re managing your time?  The art of doing this, and I’m actually talking to others who have worked from home before, and the line I heard was, “Working from home is as much about not working from home, too.”  I think that’s been harder for IT. How do you draw the boundaries? I miss transitions giving me a chance to drive and think about stuff and process. And so on hand, it’s a bit more efficient because you can move across what we are doing right now might have taken a lot more time, maybe not as a podcast.  “I miss that space to think quietly.”  But I miss the transition. I miss that space to think quietly. And so for me, that’s definitely something I need to progress better. But I’m managing my time. I have a clear sense of the major areas in the company I want to spend a percentage of my time [on]. I actually look back at my calendar every three months to see whether I spent my time on the things I wanted to spend. And I’ve always done that. So any aberrations that come out, I step back and think, “What can I do structurally to make sure I get back to how I want to spend my time?”  So it’s a constant reiterative process. And sometimes you look back in horror, and you realize you got it wrong, and then you course-correct. So that’s how I think about it.  NP: So the classic question I ask is “When do you work?” Because it’s a question I’m very focused on. It sounds like you did a lot of your time working and thinking in those transitions. How are you building that time now? Or is that something you’re just working on?  It’s a good question. I’m trying to force-block times on the calendar, specifically to read and think. I think it’s hard to do. But actually block the time and do that.  That’s how I had the time to watch your Galaxy A51 video. Sometimes just trying to understand what’s going on and spend time outside. So I think carving out that thinking time is one tool I have. But drawing boundaries is something I’m working on as well. Definitely picking up hobbies, which I never thought I had before. I made pizza last week from scratch, thanks to some YouTube cooking video. It turned out okay. And so things like that help.  NP: As you look out over the course of this next year, over the course of the crisis unfolding, what are the leading indicators of change that you’re looking at that maybe other people aren’t looking at? Maybe that’s specific to Google, maybe it’s broader than that. But what are the signals that you see? You have access to a lot of signals. What are the signals you see that indicate change is coming, one way or the other?  It’s effectively user pattern shifts, trying to understand — is telemedicine a real thing? Does it sustain? Or is it just something people do, and do people revert back to how they do things.  So looking at recovery patterns and seeing where you’re actually seeing a difference, a long-run difference, is what we are trying to piece out and understand, where we can. And we’re very interested in how does work culture shift? How does travel and meetings shift for the long run? And hence its impact on things which will do well because of that, and things which will have to adapt. So shifts like that.  Education is a big area where we are watching, and definitely I know you’ve been passionate about rural broadband and connectivity. To me, distance learning really identifies those gaps, too. And so figuring out how through both connectivity and computing we reach those things, is a long-run journey, I think, which we’re working on.  But I think trying to get those snapshots of where things are changing and trying to be data-driven and adapt is something — I do think these are moments of opportunity as well to build a future. History shows through times like this because so many people are facing so many problems, entrepreneurs rethink things and solve things. So it’s definitely worth keeping an eye on.  NP: Do you see it differently around the world? You have access to a lot of data from around the world. Some parts of the world are in different states of this. What are you seeing around the world that is giving you an indication that things are going to change in the long term?  One thing, which has been striking is — I don’t think in our lifetimes we have seen such a global moment where everyone seems to be going through a shared experience. That’s unique. So it’s kind of one of the few positives. It feels like a moment for humanity together as a whole.  But for sure, when you look at places in Asia, which have gone through and come back, we do see some shifts in areas, like as people get used to ordering online, some of those effects seem — some of the shift stays. So we see trends like that. But I see a lot more common than not, which, to me, shows the commonality of humanity, more than how different we are. So there’s more common patterns I see rather than differences.",1
"European Union and Vietnamese flags are seen at the signing ceremony of EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement at the government office in Hanoi, Vietnam June 30, 2019. REUTERS/Kham  HANOI (Reuters) - A free trade agreement with the European Union set to soon be ratified by Vietnam should boost the Asian nation’s economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, the World Bank said on Tuesday, while urging faster reforms.  Vietnam’s legislature is expected to give its final approval later this month for a deal that would see tariff reductions on 99% of goods traded with the bloc, its second-largest export market after the United States.  Its trade minister has said he expects the agreement to take effect in July.  Vietnam’s economy grew at its slowest pace in the first quarter of this year, 3.8%, as the coronavirus outbreak hit output. But with just 324 cases and no deaths, Vietnam is set to resume economic activity sooner than its regional peers.  The European Union-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA) could boost Vietnam’s GDP and exports by 2.4% and 12% respectively over the next decade and lift hundreds of thousands of people out of poverty, the World Bank said in a report.  “Such benefits are particularly urgent to lock in positive economic gains as the country responds to the COVID-19 pandemic,” the bank said.  It said now was the perfect time for Vietnam to initiate deeper reforms and fix legal gaps and implementation issues to reap the full benefits of the agreement.",1
"The men and women at the CDC are some of the most well-trained and dedicated civil servants in the country. But even those of us who have been cheerleaders for the CDC’s role in keeping the United States and the world safe recognize the need for fixing this venerable institution.  It is reasonable to ask why the CDC was unable to quickly develop and scale up testing for SARS-CoV-2, the virus’s official name. Why was there no backup plan? How come SARS-CoV-2 circulation in many parts of the United States remained undetected by the CDC’s early warning systems for at least several weeks after January? Why did the CDC not take the lead in developing, or at least systematically collating, projection models for the pandemic’s spread, which would have decreased confusion among decision-makers and the public?      If we want to avoid asking similar questions again the next time a new virus appears, the CDC needs some changes.  Over the years, there has been a substantial expansion in the types of activities the CDC is involved with. The federal agency whose original name was the Communicable Disease Center now deals with issues ranging from birth defects to injury prevention. Critics have charged that this expanded focus has resulted in dilution of the CDC’s outbreak response mission. The CDC should not ignore other health issues such as obesity and noncommunicable diseases. But it cannot afford to lose focus as the nation’s insurance policy against infectious disease threats.  Reform efforts should focus on increasing CDC’s infectious disease laboratory capacity and enhancing its expertise in scaling up testing during public health emergencies. One of the most effective ways to get ahead of outbreaks is to have a highly sensitive epidemiological surveillance system. CDC maintains several surveillance systems, but they were of limited utility as early warning systems for covid-19. CDC will have to reassess the data it acquires, how fast these data get transmitted and what analytical tools it uses to detect signals. CDC will also have to modernize the types of data it routinely uses. For example, rapidly sequencing and analyzing genomes of circulating viruses can provide important information, such as where the virus was imported from. To better prepare for fast-spreading outbreaks, CDC will have to expand the use of genomic epidemiology and other modern tools for surveillance.      The CDC also badly needs more money, and Congress has to change the way it funds the agency. Public health investments yield very high returns: For every dollar spent on prevention, there is a five times return on investment within five years. Despite this, Congress has tried to fund public health on the cheap. As a result, the CDC has been chronically underresourced. For example, CDC’s Public Health Emergency Preparedness (PHEP) program that supports states and local areas in their preparations for pandemics and other emergencies has had its funding shrunk from $940 million in 2002 to $675 million in 2020. PHEP funds can be used to develop laboratory and contact-tracing capacity — which could have come in handy in this pandemic.  CDC’s programs are micromanaged by Congress through detailed line-item budgeting, which means lawmakers and their aides have undue influence over CDC priorities. A stroll through the CDC campus can be illustrative: You arrive at the (Rep. Edward R.) Roybal campus to check in at the (Sen.) Tom Harkin communications center to walk to the (Sen.) Arlen Specter Headquarters and Emergency Operations Center. The instinct to appease political leadership was criticized by the National Academy of Sciences during another infectious disease emergency — the smallpox bioterrorism threat in 2005. A nimble, evidence-driven CDC would require flexibility in resource allocation based on scientific acumen and experience of public health professionals, rather than ideological leanings of vested interests.  The Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS), CDC’s flagship training program for its staff, needs to be modernized. This postdoctoral program trains CDC scientists in epidemiologic field work through a combination of classroom training and experiential learning. Career CDC leaders usually come from this cadre of staff; it is rare for a non-EIS-trained CDC staff to rise to the senior echelons.      EIS officers are trained in conventional methods for investigating and responding to outbreaks, such as fast-paced studies that compare exposures among those with illness labeled as “cases” and those without disease labeled as “controls.”  But the science of disease control has evolved substantially and now includes tools such as advanced mathematical modeling, genomic epidemiology and high-end laboratory methods. CDC does employ scientists with expertise in these and other emerging subfields. These skills are increasingly so seminal to modern disease control approaches, though, that they should be a major part of the core EIS training requirements. Moreover, EIS officers should be well-versed in the science of behavioral interventions — designing a smart social distancing strategy is as much about human behavior as it is about biological characteristics of the virus.  Just over a year ago in a U.S. Senate committee hearing, I was asked about the value of the CDC. Without hesitation, I described the CDC as a national treasure. I continue to believe this. And it is precisely because I have such faith in the abilities of the men and women of the CDC that I know we must reform this U.S. institution of global significance. We need it to be as excellent as it can be.",1

As covid-19 infections surged in March and April, nations worldwide experienced an abrupt reduction in driving, flying and industrial output, leading to a startling decline of more than 1 billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions. That includes a peak decline in daily emissions of 17 percent in early April, according to the study published in the journal Nature Climate Change. For some nations, the drop was much steeper.

March April May Carbon emissions declines by region 0% CHINA INDIA EUROPE & BRITAIN −5% UNITED STATES −10% change from 2019 daily average OTHER COUNTRIES −15% April Jan. Feb. March May  Scientists have long insisted that the world must scale back carbon pollution significantly — and quickly — to mitigate the worst effects of climate change over coming decades, although none have suggested that a deadly global pandemic is the way to do so.  Tuesday’s study projects that total emissions for 2020 will probably fall between 4 and 7 percent compared to last year — an unheard-of drop in normal times, but considerably less dramatic than the decline during the first few months of the year when economies screeched to a halt. The final 2020 figure will depend on how rapidly, or cautiously, people around the world resume ordinary life.  The unprecedented situation produced by the coronavirus has offered a glimpse into the massive scale required to cut global emissions, year after year, to meet the most ambitious goals set by world leaders when they forged the 2015 Paris climate accord. Last fall, a U.N. report estimated that global greenhouse gas emissions must begin falling by 7.6 percent each year beginning in 2020 to avoid the worst effects of climate change.  [In bleak report, U.N. says drastic action is only way to avoid worst effects of climate change]  Tuesday’s study underscores how far the world remains from that long-term aspiration. The forced plunge in greenhouse gas emissions in recent months, while extraordinary, returned carbon pollution levels only to those last seen in 2006. And the recent changes are unlikely to last.  “History suggests this will be a blip,” said Rob Jackson, a Stanford professor and one of the authors of the peer-reviewed study, which attempts to assess the virus’s effect by nation and economic sector. “The 2008 [financial] crisis decreased global emissions 1.5 percent for one year, and they shot back up 5 percent in 2010. It was like it never happened.”    An aerial view shows light traffic on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles on April 15 during what would normally be the evening rush hour. Federal data from March showed that Los Angeles had its longest stretch of air quality rated as “good” since 1995. (Mario Tama/Getty Images)  Although the decline in emissions during the pandemic may have been unprecedented, it was relatively small when it comes to combating global warming. The peak 17 percent decline in global emissions — which occurred in early April — meant nations continued to generate more than 80 percent of carbon pollution.  Researchers say the experience demonstrates how broad structural changes to the energy system are critical if the world is to slash emissions in a meaningful, sustainable way.  “We can see now that behavior change alone is not going to do it,” said Corinne Le Quéré, lead author of the study and director of Britain’s Tyndall Center for Climate Change Research.  Le Quéré said she expected to find even larger reductions in the power and industrial sectors during the pandemic. Instead, she said, many sources of carbon dioxide and other pollutants have continued steadily, almost on autopilot, even as much of the world has ground to a halt.  Appliances continue to run, office buildings must be maintained and some factories continue to hum.  “There’s a lot of inertia in the infrastructure, in the built environment,” she said. “It seems like many things are able to function on their own, at least for a short time.”  Emissions have fallen before — during world wars and economic recessions, for instance, and markedly during the Great Depression. But experts do not think the modern world has experienced a plunge so sudden and sharp as in recent months.  “In absolute terms, it will be the biggest,” said Glen Peters, one of the study’s authors and an expert at the Center for International Climate Research in Norway. “In relative terms, you will have to go back quite some [time] to find big changes like that.”  Most researchers agree that emissions are all but certain to bounce back once countries reopen. Already, demand for energy is resuming as people return to the roads and many U.S. states begin easing stay-at-home orders that helped drive the price per gallon of gasoline to less than $1 at some pumps.  Governments also are expected to begin trying to boost their economies with stimulus spending in the coming months. But how leaders decide to spend that money could make a fundamental difference.  “Where they put this stimulus is really critical,” Le Quéré said. “It’s 2020, and there’s not much time to tackle climate change.”  Some world leaders have pledged to push for a shift toward greener economies in the wake of the pandemic.  Last week, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said his country’s effort to slash its emissions remains “undiminished” by covid-19 and the economic turmoil it has caused. He singled out airlines during remarks in Parliament last week, saying the sector must limit its carbon emissions even when normal flights resume.  “Inadvertently, the planet this year will [have] greatly reduced its CO2 emissions. … We need to entrench those gains,” Johnson told lawmakers. “I don’t want to see us going back to an era of the same type of emissions as we’ve had in the past. Aviation like every other sector must keep its carbon lower.”    A weather balloon of Airparif, which is responsible for monitoring air quality in the Ile-de-France region, flies near the Eiffel Tower in Paris on May 7. (Joel Saget/AFP/Getty Images)  Last month, German Chancellor Angela Merkel indicated that she would support green investments as her nation seeks to restore its economy.  “It will be all the more important that if we set up economic stimulus programs, we must always keep a close eye on climate protection,” Merkel told a gathering of leaders focused on climate change.  The new research was conducted by Le Quéré, Jackson, Peters, and 10 other colleagues affiliated with the Global Carbon Project.  Normally, global emissions are calculated on an annual basis; doing so more rapidly, nearly in real time, presented a scientific challenge. Tuesday’s study used a combination of energy data across multiple sectors, as well as data on the strenuousness of lockdowns across 69 countries that account for 97 percent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, to estimate the reductions.  The results varied greatly across different sectors. Airplane emissions plunged by as much as 60 percent — but airlines represent a relatively small fraction of global emissions. Emissions from surface transportation, one of the largest sources, fell 36 percent at the peak of the shutdowns.

April 7  “Passenger vehicles are down a bit more,” Jackson said. “Commercial vehicles and long-haul trucking are down much less. I’m staying at home, but the Amazon delivery vehicle is still driving around.”  Emissions linked to home energy use actually increased about 3 percent, not surprising during a time when people are confined to their homes, using more appliances, lighting, heating and cooling. But industrial electricity demand plummeted, leading to net electricity declines overall.  Although some aspects of life may change in the wake of the pandemic — more people working remotely, fewer people commuting and taking frequent plane trips — individual changes are unlikely to make much of a long-term mark on emissions, said Zeke Hausfather, a scientist and director of climate and energy at the Breakthrough Institute.  “Unless anything structurally changes, we can expect emissions to go back to where they were before this whole thing happened,” he said.  Hausfather also said that one year of sharp reductions in emissions would do little to stave off the warming that scientists have said will continue unless the world significantly cuts emissions for good.  “I don’t think there’s much of a silver lining to covid-19 for the climate,” he said, “unless we use the recovery as a chance to both stimulate the economy and build the type of infrastructure to support a clean-energy future.”",1
"The graph became so ubiquitous that even President Trump at one point stood beside an iteration of it as his team advocated for broad social distancing efforts.  As the virus has continued to spread, experts and more casual observers have tracked daily numbers to evaluate the progress being made. Seeing a gap in data on daily testing, a group of volunteers established a project to compile individual state reports. Dashboards like the one created by researchers from Johns Hopkins University became go-to destinations for information about the virus’s spread. More sophisticated users tracked the reproduction number for the virus by state, a measure of its effective contagiousness. And when the Trump administration decided to encourage a scaling back of the containment measures, which had left a number of businesses closed, it established numeric benchmarks that states were supposed to meet before doing so.      When numbers and politics overlap, though, tension often emerges. If facts are stubborn things, numbers are nearly immobile — but not irreplaceable. In recent weeks, we have seen a number of occasions when the numbers related to the coronavirus pandemic have been misrepresented, altered or made a focus of efforts at reinterpretation as the inertia of political motivation has pushed against mathematical reality.  On Monday evening, Florida Today reported that the head of the Florida Department of Health’s data team claimed to have been forced from her position earlier this month. Rebekah Jones helped create a localized dashboard of coronavirus information used to track the spread of the virus in the state. A few weeks ago, though, control over the information was taken away from the department.  In a farewell note, Jones offered a word of caution about the data still being presented on the site.      “I would not expect the new team to continue the same level of accessibility and transparency that I made central to the process during the first two months,” Jones wrote. “After all, my commitment to both is largely (arguably entirely) the reason I am no longer managing it.”  Once the White House gave the green light for states to scale back distancing measures at the end of April, Florida quickly moved forward with doing so. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), a strong Trump ally, announced that the state would begin to reopen on May 4 — one day before Jones was removed from her position. The state did not reply to questions from Florida Today about the change in management of the data.  In Georgia, a different data-based kerfuffle emerged late last week. The state, which moved even more rapidly than Florida to scale back social distancing measures, has been a subject of scrutiny about whether it moved too quickly. So far, neither Georgia nor Florida has seen a significant increase in new infections — but things have not gone quite as well as one graph from the state’s Department of Public Health made it seem.      Political reporter Stephen Fowler noticed an anomaly in the graph showing a consistent downward trend in new cases in several large counties. That trend was a function of the data being shown out of order — May 1 was followed by April 30, which was followed by May 6, for example. The state claimed it had made a mistake, seeking to show data in a more readable way, without success. As Fowler noted, this wasn’t the primary graph detailing the spread of the virus on the site, bolstering the idea that it was simply a mistake, albeit a mistake that, at first glance, bolstered Republican Gov. Brian Kemp’s decision to reopen Georgia.  As the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported, though, this was only one of a number of data mistakes or changes made by the state government. To some extent, this is a natural function of the fluid, shifting pandemic. It nonetheless raises questions about the validity of the numbers being used to evaluate Georgia’s progress and introduces the possibility of outside influence.  Trump and his allies are certainly aware of the focus on the numbers undergirding the pandemic. The president has consistently focused on the number of new cases of coronavirus and the death toll from covid-19, the disease it causes, as measures of his administration’s success. At times, he has been explicit about his efforts to keep the numbers from being inflated, as when he said at the beginning of March that he preferred to keep passengers on a ship anchored near San Francisco to prevent the number of cases in the United States from spiking.      Earlier this month, Axios reported on a different effort by the administration to tweak the numbers. Worried about a continually increasing death toll from the virus, Trump — echoing voices on Fox News and in the conservative media — argued that the totals were being overcounted. In reality, the death toll is almost certainly being significantly undercounted, but that is far less politically useful to a president seeking reelection in November.  Again, there is a natural uncertainty to a number of these metrics, offering cover to efforts to shape what they say. In Nebraska, counts of new infections at meatpacking plants were climbing quickly — until the state stopped reporting the numbers. Gov. Pete Ricketts (R) argued that some of those who had been infected were misreporting their places of employment, making the numbers seem worse than they were. Public pressure eventually helped prompt the companies to release information about new infections.  Nationally, the data show that the number of new cases each day and the number of deaths from covid-19 have each declined. That’s obviously good news and bolsters the idea that the nation can cautiously begin relaxing some containment efforts. The question that arises, however, is whether states and the federal government will respond if those cases begin to rapidly increase again. Will there be a new push for social distancing rules?",1
"A top Florida Department of Health data manager alleges she was forced to resign from her job maintaining the state’s COVID-19 portal because she refused to change data that would “drum up support for the plan to reopen” amid the pandemic.  Rebekah Jones, the architect behind the Sunshine State’s interactive COVID-19 dashboard once praised by the White House, told several news outlets on Tuesday she was removed from her position as Graphic Information Systems manager on May 5 due to “reasons beyond my division’s control.” On Monday, the state’s Department of Health offered her a settlement with the option to resign instead of being fired, which would go into effect on May 26, she said.  Jones, 30, told CBS12 News that her involuntary removal came one day after she refused to “manually change data to drum up support for the plan to reopen.” The scientist, however, did not elaborate on which data in particular she refused to alter.  States Are Starting to Reopen Amid the Coronavirus Pandemic. Here Are Their Plans.  To date, nearly 2,000 Floridians have died and 46,442 have been diagnosed with the coronavirus. Despite the ongoing public health issue, Gov. Ron Desantis announced last week his plan to open up Florida’s virus-stricken economy.  The news of Jones’ ouster was first revealed in a May 5 farewell email she sent to researchers and members of the public who signed up to receive updates on the data portal. In the email, Jones said her department was no longer responsible for updating information on the site “in any shape or form.”  “As a word of caution, I would not expect the new team to continue the same level of accessibility and transparency that I made central to the process during the first two months. After all, my commitment to both is largely (arguably entirely) the reason I am no longer managing it,” Jones wrote. “They are making a lot of changes. I would advise being diligent in your respective uses of this data.”  The COVID-19 Data and Surveillance Dashboard provides daily updates on the numbers of deaths, new cases, and tests for every county in the state. Seen as one of the leading trackers in the state, the portal is heavily relied upon by officials, academics, and residents as Florida moves toward restarting the economy three months after issuing a stay-at-home order.  According to internal emails obtained by the Tampa Bay Times, reporters contacted the department on May 4 about a field of data that showed when residents first began to report their virus symptoms or testing positive. The data, according to the emails, showed that Floridians were experiencing symptoms as early as Jan. 1—three months earlier than when the first COVID-19 case was confirmed in the state.  ‘Hopefully, The Virus Is Dying in That Room’: A New York Nurse Bids Farewell to a Coronavirus ICU  That field of data vanished from the portal several hours later, the Times reported. Then, at around 5 p.m. on May 5, Department of Health I.T. Director Craig Curry messaged Jones asking her to “disable the ability to export data” from the interactive COVID-19 site.  “Per Dr. Blackmore, disable the ability to export the data to files from the dashboard immediately,” Curry wrote, referring to Dr. Carina Blackmore, the director of the Division of Disease Control and Health Protection in Florida. “We need to ensure that dates (date fields) in all objects match their counterpart on the PDF line list published.”  Minutes later, Jones responded saying “this is the wrong call” before complying with the request. About an hour later, at 6 p.m. on May 5, the I.T. director emailed both Jones and Blackmore asking them to “re-enable” the ability to export data “for now.”  The Florida Department of Health did not immediately respond to The Daily Beast’s request for comment.  “Allegations that Florida’s government may have tried to manipulate or alter data to make reopening appear safer is outrageous. These kinds of actions are dangerous and, frankly, should be criminal,” Terrie Rizzo, chair of the Florida Democratic Party, said in a Tuesday statement to The Daily Beast. “An independent investigation into these allegations is needed immediately. Meanwhile, city and state officials across Florida should closely monitor the situation to protect the public’s health.”",1
"New numbers from the Penn Wharton Budget Model show that reopening states could cause positive coronavirus case numbers to tick as high as 5.4 million by July 24.  The model explores various scenarios under which states reopen, include continuing lockdowns, and a partial reopening. The model also forecasts those scenarios if social distancing rules continue to be adhered to or are relaxed.  For the PWBM forecast, the model considers that states reopen on May 18. All totals are cumulative, and include past positive cases and deaths.  If states fully reopen with no social distancing rules in place, as many as 5.4 million people could test positive for coronavirus. And if states reopen while still practicing measures of social distancing, nearly 4.3 million people are projected to be diagnosed with COVID-19 by the third week of July.  Partially reopening the states with social distancing rules in place would result in nearly 3.2 million positive cases.  The forecast represents a large uptick in positive cases in the United States which currently stands at 1.5 million, according to the Johns Hopkins coronavirus tracker.  And according to the PWBM, the number of deaths would also start to rise as states reopen.  Customers stand in line outside ""Forever 21"" store inside a Mall west of Fort Lauderdale, on May 18, 2020. South Florida begins a gradual reopening of its economy on May 18,2020 with the start of activities of some restaurants and businesses in Miami and Fort Lauderdale, but the beaches will still be closed until further notice. (Photo by CHANDAN KHANNA/AFP via Getty Images) More  While previous forecasts from the University of Pennsylvania model had projected a death toll as high as 350,000, the new numbers are lower, though still higher than other models.  Even with states under a full lockdown, the model has projected a death toll at just over 156,000, a slight increase from its previous forecasts of 117,000.  The current death toll in the United States stands at nearly 91,000, according to Johns Hopkins.  But while this scenario is grim, it only serves as the baseline as more and more states reopen and others mull when and how to let business and other normal activities resume.  With a partial reopening, the model forecasts, the death toll will rise to 173,000 people. A full reopening would result in 231,000 deaths. If all the states reopened without adhering to social distancing guidance, that number leaps to 293,000.  While these numbers are large, they represent a revision downward from Wharton’s previous forecast of 350,000. They are also much larger than other models.  According to the University of Washington Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) model, the current projected death toll stands at roughly 144,000 by Aug. 4.  While the forecasts seem to warn against a full reopening of states, the model does project positive data economically if states reopen.  There are over 1.5 million coronavirus cases in the U.S. (Graphic: David Foster/Yahoo Finance) More  Keeping states in lockdown with full social distancing in place will cause U.S. GDP to shrink by 10.8% year over year by July 24, but reopening states would save the U.S. from the severe economic losses.  Towards the end of July the model forecasts, if states reopen GDP would decline by 7.7% compared to the year prior. And if social distancing is reduced, GDP would decline by 6.6%.",1
"(Reuters) - Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Inter Milan have announced a mini tournament called the ‘European Solidarity Cup - Football for Heroes’, to raise funds for health care resources in Italy and Spain which have been depleted by the COVID-19 pandemic.  FILE PHOTO: Soccer Football - Champions League Semi Final Second Leg - Real Madrid v Bayern Munich - Santiago Bernabeu, Madrid, Spain - May 1, 2018 Real Madrid's Gareth Bale in action with Bayern Munich's Joshua Kimmich REUTERS/Michael Dalder/File Photo  In separate statements, the clubs announced that the matches would take place at each of their stadiums and would raise money for boosting healthcare resources in Italy and Spain, but not in Germany.  “The net proceeds from all three games will be donated to medical facilities in Italy and Spain,” said Bayern’s statement.  “FC Bayern sees its contribution as a symbol of support for a united Europe, in which everyone takes responsibility for each other.”  Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge added: “Despite all the suffering and all the problems, we in Germany are perhaps fortunate that our healthcare system is proving resilient in this crisis.  “But we have also seen horrifying images from Italy and Spain, both countries among those hardest hit in Europe by the pandemic.”  Italy is the second-worst affected country in Europe behind Britain by the coronavirus, with a death toll of more than 32,000. Spain is the third-worst affected, with over 27,000 people dying from the virus.  Germany has fared comparatively well, registering 8,007 deaths despite having the highest population in Western Europe.  Last Saturday, the Bundesliga became the first major soccer league in Europe to resume action after the virus paralysed world sport in March.  Bayern will host Real at the Allianz Arena in Munich, Real will play against Inter at their Santiago Bernabeu stadium, while Inter would host Bayern at the San Siro.  The three clubs added that healthcare professionals who have fought against the pandemic would be invited to the matches, which will take place when it is safe for supporters to return to stadiums without risk of being infected by the virus.",1
"Earlier this spring, when asked if Central Michigan was considering cutting athletic programs amid the COVID-19 financial crisis, athletic director Michael Alford said, ""We're not there, yet.""  On Tuesday, however, Central Michigan got there.  Central Michigan became the first Division I school in the state to eliminate an athletic program as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the immediate discontinuation of men's indoor and outdoor track and field — a decision that will save the university hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, but also one that leaves the athletic department out of compliance, having fallen under the minimum number of men's sports offerings.  Central Michigan has cut its men's indoor and outdoor track programs. (Photo: Central Michigan athletics)  The move affects 36 student-athletes, some of whom also run cross country, a program that remains.  ""Every business, every industry is going through this right now,"" Alford said Tuesday afternoon on a conference call with reporters. ""As you come up with problems and issues, you've gotta find a solution.  ""Right now, for our financial sustainability, this is the decision, the solution I came to.  ""As an AD, it's probably the hardest thing of your life.""  Scholarships will be granted for the duration of a student's college career, if they choose to stay at CMU, and that includes incoming freshmen. Students who wish to transfer can do so without penalty. Two assistant-coaching positions also were eliminated.  Jenny Swieton oversaw the men's programs, and will remain on the job as head of women's track and field and men's and women's cross country.  The men's indoor and outdoor track and field programs had an annual budget of $629,798, which will be the long-time annual savings. In the short term, savings will be around $300,000 a year.  The decision leaves Central Michigan with 16 sports programs, the NCAA Division I minimum. Early in the COVID-19 crisis, five mid-major conferences, including the Mid-American Conference, sent the NCAA a memo asking for a temporary waiver for sports minimums, but the NCAA denied it.  It also leaves Central Michigan with five men's teams, one below the NCAA Division I requirement. Alford has been working with the NCAA on a temporary waiver, and expects an answer soon, perhaps as early as Wednesday. If the NCAA doesn't approve the waiver, Alford said he has a fallback plan, but didn't elaborate.  ""I have various models to make sure we're in full compliance this year,"" Alford said.  Colleges across the country have been scrambling to get their books in order amid the COVID-19 crisis, which has shut down sports for sevearl weeks and left athletic departments bracing for massive cuts. The cancellation of the NCAA Tournament cost mid-major schools like Central critical six-figure paydays. Projected declining enrollment is a major concern, as well.  Earlier this month, Central Michigan announced that Alford was taking an 8% pay cut, and the school's three highest-paid coaches — Jim McElwain (football), Keno Davis (men's basketball) and Heather Oesterle (women's basketball) — would see 6% pay cuts. Western Michigan recently announced similar pay cuts, and also Tuesday, Eastern Michigan said its football and basketball coaches would get 7% salary reductions.  Central Michigan joins other Mid-American Conference schools Akron (men's cross country, men's golf, women's tennis) and Bowling Green (baseball) in cutting sports. Additionally, the MAC announced the elimination of several postseason conference tournaments, and scaled-down basketball tournaments.  Alford said there are no plans to cut additional sports teams, but also said there's little to no chance of men's track ever being brought back, even if the financial outlook improves in the coming years.  In his conference call with reporters, Alford choked up multiple times talking about the student athletes.  ""We've been trying to make it work,"" said Alford, who has been bouncing between six and seven different budget models. ""It's just impossible to make it work without this reduction.""  The last Division I school in Michigan to eliminate teams was Eastern in March 2018, axing men's swimming and diving and wrestling, and women's tennis and softball. A lengthy court case forced Eastern to reinstate women's tennis, and it is in the process of adding women's lacrosse to substitute for softball.  tpaul@detroitnews.com  Twitter: @tonypaul1984",1
"Presidential reelection campaigns are generally referendums on the incumbent. A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.  By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”  But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.  Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.  Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”  When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.  Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.  “The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham  But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”  The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.  When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”  A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.  Others are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)",1
"Carmelle Harris saw the man standing at the open front door of her house.  “Are you here for the haircut?’’ she asked.  He was, and so Harris, wearing an N95 face mask, handed sanitary wipes to the man, and led him to the makeshift barber's chairin the living room.  Soft music played in the background as a breeze kicked up and wind chimes jingled. The smell of citrus-scented candles and incense co-mingled as the customer, John Batinovich of Hollywood, settled into the barber's chair.  “You’ve got a great set up here,’’ he said.  It’s also illegal — and during the coronavirus pandemic, the hair industry is drawing legal scrutiny across the country.  In Texas, Shelley Luther was arrested after she defied an order to close her salon during the COVID-19 outbreak. She spent two days in jail and was fined $7,000.  In Michigan, Karl Manke's professional and business licenses were suspended after he refused to close his barbershop. Manke, 77, was charged with two criminal misdemeanors for defying the governor’s stay-at-home orders.  In California, the state has threatened disciplinary action against open salons and said it is investigating 651 related complaints. The city of Los Angeles has filed criminal complaints against four hair salons and one barbershop — along with 55 other businesses — that were open in violation of the city’s Safer at Home orders, Los Angeles City Attorney Mike Feuer said last week.  Also last week, the Ulster County Department of Health and Mental Health in New York announced that a barber had tested positive for COVID-19 after cutting hair after the state put shutdown orders in place.  The number of hairstylists setting up shop at home or coloring and cutting hair at customers’ homes is on the rise as stay-at-home orders in states like California have stretched beyond eight weeks, more than a dozen hair stylists and industry experts told USA TODAY.  Financial pressure is cited as the chief reason hairstylists like Harris of Compton, California have put their cosmetology licenses at risk. Two weeks ago, Harris decided she had little choice.  “Do I take a chance and get turned into a criminal because I decided to work and pay my bills on time?’’ said Harris, 38. “Or do I just sit and watch my bills pile up, so when the economy does open up I’m thousands and thousands of dollars in debt?’’  There is no legal ambiguity in the state.  ""California law requires that all services be performed in a licensed establishment,’’ Cheri Gyuro, public information officer for the California Department of Consumer Affairs, told USA TODAY. Similar laws are in effect in every other state, said Steve Sleeper, executive director of the Professional Beauty Association.  But the hairstylists and barbers are fighting to regain legal work opportunities during the pandemic.  Last week , The Center for American Liberty filed a federal lawsuit against California Gov. Gavin Newsom on behalf of the Professional Beauty Federation of California. It was an attempt to get hair salons reopened statewide.  5,000 miles away, stylists are worried  In Connecticut, Salon owner Odete DaSilva said she is among thousands of hairstylists and salon owners urging Gov. Ned Lamont to push back the May 20 date when salons and barbershops will be allowed to reopen. She said they fear the risks of getting infected with COVID-19 are too high to go back to work and allowing them to do so would end their ability to collect unemployment benefits.  “It’s such a divisive issue, right?’’ said Steve Sleeper, executive director of the Professional Beauty Association. “Our members are the same way that the rest of the country plays out. Half are thinking, ‘Hey, it’s too soon, let’s wait and make things safe.’ And the other half is, ‘Let’s go-go-go-go.’ “  The sense of urgency led one Southern California hairdresser to create in her garage a makeshift salon, complete with a hood dryer and a shampoo bowl. She spoke on the condition of anonymity because she said her cosmetology license could be revoked but allowed USA TODAY to take photos.  Upon arrival, the hairdresser said, her clients have been instructed to text her rather ring the doorbell to keep her two dogs from barking and eliminate unnecessary noise that might draw attention from neighbors.  The choice to defy or abide by state orders that govern the hair industry has become part of pandemic politics.  After Luther was released from a Dallas jail, Texas senator Ted Cruz got a haircut at her Salon à la Mode. Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick announced he would pay Luther’s $7,000 fine, although the salon owner now has ample money to handle it.  She received more than $500,000 from a GoFundMe campaign that was started a day before she reopened her salon, and recently Luther started a nonprofit called “Courage to Stand.’’  On May 14, Luther told USA TODAY she was driving from to Michigan to offer support for Manke, the barber who is facing jail time after refusing to close his barbershop in Owosso, a town of about 15,000.  “My attorneys have been in touch with his attorneys,’’ said Luther, 46. “Even if it’s just showing my face, I need to go out there and support this man.  “Right now, I want to speak with actions and make sure everybody in the United States realizes that we’re getting our rights and freedoms taken away, and we need to take them back immediately.’’  Manke did not reply to interview requests.  'Everything is super clean'  In an interview at the small stucco house where she lives with two roommates, Harris did not speak about politics. But she spoke intently about health and safety, saying she recently completed two online courses and received COVID-19 certification from Barbicide, a company that sells products designed to clean and disinfect salons.  One of Harris’s roommates was helping her disinfect between customers.  “Everything is super clean,’’ Harris said of her makeshift salon.  But it’s unlikely the California State Board of Barbering and Cosmetology will be impressed based on warning it issued May 1 by social media.  “The Board urges licensees to follow the stay at home orders,’’ the post read. “If businesses continue to put public health and safety at risk by not following the guidance provided, and if circumstances warrant it, the Board may pursue disciplinary action against their license. This will not be taken lightly.’’  But last week, at the Sassoon Salon in Beverly Hills, the front door was open and a hairstylist was cutting a man’s hair. Neither were wearing a face mask. Susie Mutch, the global marketing director for Sassoon, did not respond to a request for comment.  In Brookhaven, Mississippi, Dedra Edwards said she's worried for hairstylists and barbers going back to work after her brother Eugene, a longtime barber, died of COVID-19 in April at the age of 46.  Dedra Edwards said her family thinks 46-year-old Eugene Edwards was infected with COVID-19 during a hair show in Jackson, Mississippi on March 15. Eugene Edwards was not wearing a face mask because the hair show was held before the state-at-home order was imposed, according to Dedra Edwards.  She said safety should be paramount as salons and barbershops reopen.  “I know they’re using masks,’’ Dedra Edwards said. “But you don’t know the client you’re working with, and you can carry COVID-19 and not have any symptoms.’’  Safety was part of the motivation when the Center for American Liberty filed the lawsuit on behalf of the PBFC, said attorney Fred Jones, counsel for the group representing the beauty and barbering industry.  “Tell me, what’s safer,” Jones said, “having (hairstylists and barbers) go from one kitchen to the next kitchen? Or having all of those ladies and men come into the controlled environment of the salon, where they maintain cross-contamination controls?''  After entering Harris’s home, Batinovich explained that he'd seen her on Craigslist, where a slew of hairstylists are advertising their services. The demand is high, several hairstylists told USA TODAY, and Harris said she averages between five and 10 customers per day.  She is charging $20 a haircut and making about as much as she does when she’s working at a Floyd’s 99 Barbershop.  Working with an electric razor, small comb and scissors, Harris needed about 20 minutes to complete Batinovich's haircut.  “You look good,’’ she said.  Batinovich smiled.  “I feel good,’’ he said.",1
"Can’t find Clorox wipes? Here’s what to buy instead  You can still find cleaning wipes and spray in stock at select retailers. (Photo: Getty Images / urbazon)  — Recommendations are independently chosen by Reviewed’s editors. Purchases you make through our links may earn us a commission.  As people are trying to stay safe and disinfect their homes during the coronavirus pandemic, families are searching for ways to buy hand sanitizer, toilet paper and other household essentials to help them stay safe and healthy in quarantine.  One of the biggest problems, though, is that most of those everyday products are still selling out at lightning-quick speeds. This is especially true when it comes to cleaning wipes, which topped the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) list of disinfectants that can help protect against COVID-19. Lysol spray and Clorox wipes could even potentially be in low supply through the end of June.  Whatever you do, don't panic—you can still get your hands on enough cleaning supplies for the whole family—and skip the big crowds in stores—if you shop them at these online retailers. While we'll be updating this list daily, supplies are selling out extremely fast, so we recommend not putting it off more than you need to. Here are the places online where you can buy cleaning wipes and spray right now.  Need help finding products? Sign up for our weekly newsletter. It’s free and you can unsubscribe at any time.  Where to buy cleaning wipes and spray  Cleaning wipes that actually disinfect surfaces are one of the hardest things to find right now, but you can occasionally get them along with cleaning sprays at the following retailers:  Staples  Target  Walmart  Make your own disinfectant wipes  Despite the current shortage of Lysol and Clorox wipes, you can also make your own CDC-approved wipes right at home using a precise balance of bleach or alcohol. We put together comprehensive instructions on how to do so.  How to use cleaning wipes  If you already have cleaning supplies around the house, you'll want to be certain that you're using them the right way. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), disinfection won't happen immediately—it can actually take up to three to five minutes.  Although wipes and sprays are on the EPA's list of approved disinfectants, you may not be using them long enough to keep whatever surface you're cleaning—like a countertop, for instance—wet for the recommended amount of time to kill germs.  As a good rule of thumb, you may want to set a timer so you can monitor surfaces to ensure they're still wet. You may also want to make sure that you're sanitizing frequently-used objects and surfaces daily, especially when it comes to doorknobs, keyboards, faucet handles and more. You don't want to forget your phone, either—you can even use Clorox wipes or 70% isopropyl alcohol on Apple products, according to Apple.  Jonathan Chan, senior lab testing technician at Reviewed, recommends following best practices, and advises that if you're using wipes, you should make sure you're only wiping in one one direction, as studies have suggested that doing so can reduce the risk of recontamination.

"Defense Secretary Mark Esper pictured with White House coronavirus response coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx and Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Dr. Anthony Fauci: AP Photo/Alex Brandon  A leaked Pentagon draft memo says that the US should expect for the coronavirus pandemic to last until the summer of 2021, according to those that have seen it.  The Department of Defence document, obtained by Task & Purpose, advises the that the military prepare for a “globally-persistent” Covid-19 environment with no effective vaccine until “at least the summer of 2021.  Authored by Secretary of Defence Mark Esper, though not finalised or signed by him, the memo warns against any complacency that the virus will now be easily defeated: “We have a long path ahead, with the real possibility of a resurgence of Covid-19.”  It continues: “Therefore we must now refocus our attention on resuming critical missions, increasing levels of activity, and making necessary preparations should a significant resurgence of Covid-19 occur later this year.”  These preparations are likely to include the repositioning of forces and supplies in a faster-paced summer move cycle in which personnel are redeployed domestically and internationally.  Task & Purpose reports that the memo was prepared by Kenneth Rapuano, assistant secretary of defence for homeland defence and global security. It is intended as an update to a 1 April guidance document issued by Mr Esper.  A Pentagon spokesperson said that the new document is outdated. Indeed, since early May it had been circulated among the various branches of the military for feedback, a source told Task & Purpose. It is unclear if Mr Esper has yet seen the document.  Pentagon sources confirmed to The Hill that there are versions of plans with similar language to the leaked memo, but none have been approved. Senior officials are also discussing plans to continue with the summer 2020 move cycle — also not yet finalised.  “All indications suggest we will be operating in a globally-persistent Covid-19 environment in the months ahead,” the memo reads. “This will likely continue until there is wide-scale immunity, through immunisation, and some immunity post-recovery from the virus.”  As well as predicting no viable treatment or vaccine until next summer at the earliest, the scenario laid out by the Pentagon assumes successive waves of infection in clusters tied to seasonal flu outbreaks; continued shortages of personal protective equipment; and testing not being able to completely assure an absence of the virus, and therefore requiring extensive contact tracing and monitoring.  As recently as Friday, Mr Esper said that the Pentagon would “deliver by the end of this year a vaccine at scale to treat the American people and our partners abroad.”  A spokesperson later clarified that the end of the year was “a goal”, and experts believe that even if everything were to go perfectly, a 12 to 18-month timeline for a widespread rollout of a vaccine would be optimistic.

"What about 'Deaths of Despair'?  As of this writing, more than 80,000 Americans have contracted and died from the coronavirus. But how many have or will die from what some call ""despair""?  Consider the following call to my radio show:  ""Hi, Larry. I was calling about people who have called suicide hotlines and different things with this loss of income. I am a widow of somebody who did commit suicide because of income. It was not now, during the epidemic, but it was because of dwindling income and hopelessness, which he hid from me. I had no idea this was going on in his business life. And I came home from work one day and found him hanging in the garage. He did leave a note about the different debts and things like that, but financial problems are a horrible thing — just a horrible thing that's worse than the virus.""  No doubt going back to work increases a person's chances of exposure to the COVID-19 virus. More will contract the virus and die from it than would have been the case under continued lockdowns. But this, of course, is not the full picture.  A new report, ""Projected Deaths of Despair During the Coronavirus Recession,"" suggests as many as 75,000 Americans could die from ""despair"" due to unemployment, depression from isolation, and fear of the indefinite and uncertain nature of the pandemic. One of the study's authors, Benjamin Miller, chief strategy officer for Well Being Trust in Oakland, California, said: ""Deaths of despair are tied to multiple factors, like unemployment, fear and dread, and isolation. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, there were already an unprecedented number of deaths of despair. We wanted to estimate how this pandemic would change that number moving forward."" The study estimates that there could be 75,000 coronavirus-related ""deaths of despair"" from drug or alcohol abuse and suicide. Miller explained, ""The isolation is causing people to lose boundaries on their behaviors. ... People have to be working and we have to get people connected to other people.""  About the study, Dr. Elie Aoun, vice chairman of the American Psychiatric Association's Council on Addiction Psychiatry, said: ""I've been seeing this in practices and my colleagues have been talking about it, too. ... Addiction patients are relapsing, and a lot of patients who don't have drug use or alcohol problems are drinking more now, sometimes every day from 4 or 5 p.m., and they don't stop until they sleep.""  Earlier this year, I wrote about the connection between suicide and unemployment. A British journal, The Lancet Psychiatry, published a study associating worldwide suicides to unemployment. ""Our findings reveal that the suicide rate increases six months before a rise in unemployment,"" said study author Carlos Nordt. ""Our data suggest that not all job losses necessarily have an equal impact, as the effect on suicide risk appears to be stronger in countries where being out of work is uncommon."" The study said that between 2000 and 2011, there were an estimated 233,000 suicides in 63 countries, and that the number increased during the last recession: ""While the number of unemployment-related suicides increased by about 5,000 during the recent economic crisis in 2008, this analysis shows the risk of suicide among jobless people is high even in good economic times.""  Unemployment stands at 14.7%, with over 20 million Americans in April filing for unemployment. The number of unemployed Americans is likely understated. Betsey Stevenson, former member of the Council of Economic Advisers as well as the chief economist of the U.S. Department of Labor, says due to an incorrect classification of ""people who were employed (but) absent from work due to COVID-related reasons as temporarily unemployed,"" the actual number of unemployed is likely over 20%.  A new ESPN documentary about the Chicago Bulls' last championship season describes how Michael Jordan broke his foot early in his pro career, during the third game of the 1985-86 season. Defying his doctors' expectations, the foot healed faster than expected, and Jordan itched to return to the court despite team owner Jerry Reinsdorf's fear not only that Jordan could reinjure the foot but that such a reinjury could end his career. Reinsdorf said to Jordan, ""If you had a terrible headache, and I gave you a bottle of pills, and nine of the pills would cure you and one of the pills would kill you, would you take a pill?"" Jordan responded, ""It depends on how bad the f—-ing headache is.""  America's economic headache from the coronavirus stay-at-home orders is f—-ing bad.",0
"There is a dire need for financial support of healthcare providers and facilities as they continue to battle the COVID-19 pandemic, now affecting the United States the most drastically. In response, the President signed the bipartisan CARES Act on March 27, 2020, providing much-needed relief funds to hospitals and other healthcare providers on the frontlines of the fight against coronavirus. As part of the recently announced CARES Act, $100 billion will be appropriated to create a Public Health Social Service Emergency Fund with an ultimate goal of preventing, preparing for, and responding to the coronavirus outbreak both domestically and on an international scale.  Per the Act, funding will be dedicated to reimbursing healthcare-related expenses or lost revenue attributable to COVID-19 to alleviate some of the financial burden many providers are experiencing. Part of this relief payment will focus on ensuring that uninsured Americans have access to testing and treatment, and that medical professionals providing the care are reimbursed for their work. The Department of Health and Human Services has published detailed criteria for the process of distribution of funds under the Act as well as information about eligibility requirements, outlined below.  Immediate Relief Funding  Recognizing the urgent need for the delivery of financial relief, the HHS immediately infused $30 billion into the American healthcare system. Payments are slated to arrive via direct deposit beginning April 10, 2020 to eligible providers throughout the system. Note, these are direct payments, not loans and will not need to be repaid, the HHS emphasizes.  Eligibility for Immediate Relief Payments  Per guidance from the HHS, all facilities and providers that received Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) reimbursements in 2019 are eligible to receive payments from this initial rapid distribution. Payments to practices that are part of larger medical groups will be sent to the group’s central billing office, while all relief payments will be made to the billing organization according to its Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN).  In order to be eligible to receive these funds, providers must not seek to collect of out-of-pocket payments from a COVID-19 patient that are greater than what they would be otherwise had the care been provided by an in-network practitioner. If a practice had to halt business operations as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, providers may still be eligible to receive funds if they provided diagnoses, testing, or care for patients with possible or confirmed cases of COVID-19. Per the HHS, “Care does not have to be specific to treating COVID-19. HHS broadly views every patient as a possible case of COVID-19.”  The immediate relief payments hope to alleviate providers in hard-hit COVID-19 areas and those who are struggling to keep their practice open due to delayed care and widespread cancellations of elective procedures.  Payment Distributions  Payment distributions will be based on the provider’s or practice’s share of total Medicare FFS reimbursements for the year 2019; that year, the total FFS payments were approximately $484 billion. Providers can estimate their anticipated payment by dividing their 2019 Medicare FFS (excluding Medicare Advantage) payments – which can be obtained from their organization’s revenue management system – by $484 billion and multiplying that ratio by $30 billion.  Receiving Payments  In partnership with UnitedHealth Group (UHG), the HHS will provide rapid payments to eligible providers, as described above, to distribute the initial round of funding. Providers will be paid via their Automated Clearing House account information on file with UHG or the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and can expect to receive payments via Optum Bank with “HHSPAYMENT” as the payment description. Providers who receive reimbursements from CMS via paper check can expect to receive a paper check in the mail within the next few weeks.  Providers must sign an attestation confirming receipt of the funds and agreeing to the terms and conditions of payment within 30 days of receipt. The Terms and Conditions of the funding can be found on the CMS website. If the payment is not returned within 30 days, the HHS will view this as an acceptance of the Terms and Conditions. However, if a provider does not wish to comply with the Terms and Conditions, they must contact HHS within 30 days of receipt of payment and then return the full payment to HHS.  Different Types of Providers  All relief payments are being made to providers according to their tax identification number (TIN). Large organizations will receive payments for each of their billing TINs that bill Medicare, and should look to the part of their organization that handles Medicare billing to identify details on Medicare payments for 2019. Employed physicians should not expect to receive an individual payment directly; instead, their employer’s organization will receive the relief payment as the billing organization. Similarly, individual physicians and providers in a group practice are unlikely to receive individual payments directly; the group practice will receive the relief fund payment as the billing organization. Solo practitioners who bill Medicare will receive a payment under the TIN they use to bill Medicare.  The Remaining $70 Billion  As part of the $100 billion guaranteed by the CARES Act, the remaining $70 billion will be comprised of targeted distributions focused on providers in areas particularly impacted by the virus, rural providers, providers of services with lower shares of Medicare reimbursement or who predominantly serve the Medicaid population, as well as providers requesting reimbursement for the treatment of uninsured Americans. More guidance is expected on the structure of these payments in the coming weeks.  COVID-19 Medical Expenses  The federal government is taking measures to ensure Americans are not surprised by medical expenses and are protected against financial obstacles that might prevent them from seeking care or getting tested and treated for COVID-19. A portion of the Provider Relief Fund will be used to reimburse healthcare providers at Medicare rates for COVID-related treatment of the uninsured. However, providers are prohibited from “balance billing” any patient for COVID-related treatment in order to be eligible.  In addition, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act requires private insurers to cover an insurance plan member’s cost-sharing payments for COVID-19 testing. Further, the government has secured commitments from private insurers – such as Humana, Cigna, UnitedHealthGroup, and the Blue Cross Blue Shield system – to waive cost-sharing payments for treatment related to COVID-19 for its members and make medical care more accessible.  Heavily anticipated by providers across the nation, the latest guidance helps to clarify eligibility, distribution, and payment concerns regarding the Provider Relief Fund. Eligible practices and providers may soon expect to receive payments from the immediate round of funding. In the meantime, medical professionals can access more information about and the latest developments concerning the CARES Act Provider Relief Fund here.",0
"The Associated Press  Oprah Winfrey is giving grants to the cities she’s called home through her $12 million coronavirus relief fund.  She announced Wednesday that her Oprah Winfrey Charitable Foundation will donate money to organizations dedicated to helping underserved communities in Chicago; Baltimore; Nashville, Tennessee; Milwaukee; and Kosciusko, Mississippi, where she was born.  “The reason I’m talking about it is because there is going to be a need for people of means to step up,” Winfrey said in an interview with The Associated Press. “I mean, this thing is not going away. Even when the virus is gone, the devastation left by people not being able to work for months who were holding on paycheck to paycheck, who have used up their savings — people are going to be in need. So my thing is, look in your own neighborhood, in your own backyard to see how you can serve and where your service is most essential. That is the real essential work, I think, for people of means.”  After speaking with Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot and other leaders, Winfrey decided to give $5 million to Live Healthy Chicago, which provides immediate support to seniors and high-risk residents affected by the coronavirus.  In Nashville, where Winfrey lived with her father and started her media career, she is giving $2 million to NashvilleNurtures, a collaboration with Mount Zion Baptist Church and Tennessee State University, Winfrey’s alma mater. They plan to feed 10,000 families in and around the city.  In Milwaukee, where she lived with her mother, Winfrey is assisting those in need of housing and mental health care with a $100,000 donation to SaintA and The Nia Imani Family, Inc.  Staying Apart, Together:A newsletter about how to cope with the coronavirus pandemic  In Baltimore, where Winfrey also built her media career, she’s donating money to Living Classrooms Foundation and Center for Urban Families.  She will also give $115,000 to the Boys and Girls Club of East Mississippi.  “I’m not opposed to big organizations dispersing money, but I always like to do the on-the-ground grassroots stuff myself,” she said. “Look, I want to be able to reach people who have been incarcerated and are coming out of prison. I want to reach mothers of domestic violence. I want to reach people. I want to feed people. I want to help people get access to testing.”  Winfrey said she’s been homebound since March 11, four days after she wrapped her nine-city wellness tour that visited arenas like Barclays Center in Brooklyn and the Forum in Inglewood, California.  She announced her COVID-19 Relief Fund last month, initially giving $1 million to America’s Food Fund. She said Wednesday that she will also give grants to advocacy organization Global Citizen, New Mount Pilgrim Missionary Baptist Church in Chicago and Minnie’s Food Pantry in Plano, Texas, among other organizations.  More:Oprah, Cardi B, more stars share inspiring advice to grads on Facebook's #Graduation2020  'Let’s reset':Oprah is here to help you cope amid coronavirus with free online wellness seminars  Before giving out millions to others, Winfrey said she first helped the people closest to her.  “The first thing I did was start in my own family, people I knew who were going to be touched and were not going to have jobs. Then I moved out to people who I’ve worked with and known who maybe would be out of work. I started literally here, working my way out, and then into the community. So people who I hadn’t spoken to in years ended up getting checks from me like, ‘What is this?’/p>  “All the cousins and some aunties — try to help your own family first,” she added. “I didn’t want an announcement about, ‘I’m going out into the world trying to help other people’ and then your own family saying, ‘Hey, I can’t pay my light bill. I can’t pay my rent.’”  Last week, Winfrey gave a commencement speech during Facebook’s virtual “Graduation 2020” event, and asked the graduates, “What will your essential service be?” She said she’s asked herself the same question.  “What this pandemic has done is made me think about giving differently. How I give and who’s on the receiving end of that, and how do you do that in such a way that sustains people? I’ve ultimately always believed that you teach people to fish ... but sometimes people just need fish and a piece of bread,” she said. “Sometimes you need some fish, OK? Sometimes you don’t have time to learn to fish. I just need some fish today!”",1
"Presidential reelection campaigns are generally referendums on the incumbent. A falling unemployment rate and rising stock market were once Trump’s measures of success. But after a manic 3½ years, the referendum on Trump may come down to the single issue of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, in a White House once obsessed with statistical boasts, those close to the president are loath to set any milestones defining a positive outcome.  By far the most sensitive subject is the awful reality of the growing death count. “I’m not going to play that game,” said one White House official when asked if there is a number of dead Americans beyond what the public would tolerate. “I think all these body count things are somewhat gross and the definitions are kind of fu--ed up and they’re not uniform across states and across countries.”  But even beyond the death count, there’s a widespread reluctance to define what success means. “I’m not going to get into this game four or five months from now about what any particular metric needs to look like,” the official said.  Some Trump allies on the outside see a White House that doesn’t understand the enormity of the coronavirus catastrophe and hasn’t been able to focus on getting the response right.  Trump has repeatedly compared his pandemic response to fighting a war. “So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we open successfully and we have a successful country again,” he said on May 1. “It can never be a total victory because too many people have died.”  When American war deaths in Vietnam spiked in 1967 and early 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he wouldn’t seek a second term. When the Iraq War spun out of control in George W. Bush’s second term, his presidency collapsed. Similarly, there is now a grim conversation quietly happening in Republican circles about the Covid-19 death count, with some saying that if there are 250,000 people dead by Election Day, it will be hard for Trump to win reelection.  Others are slightly more optimistic that the overall number of deaths is less important than the trajectory of new cases and whether there are signs of an economic rebound. “Allowing people to get to some semblance of normal without a second wave occurring and the economy showing glimmers of hope would be a success,” argued one Republican close to the president.  “The closer you can have it to 120 [thousand deaths], I think you can say you limited the casualties in this war.” Sen. Lindsey Graham  But, he added, “If things don’t look like they’re bouncing back by September, I think that’s going to be a problem.”  The fear that Trump can’t survive a referendum on his handling of the crisis has allies pushing a series of change-the-subject strategies. The more the pandemic response becomes a polarized issue, the more that political narrative rather than raw statistics could matter.  When asked about what constitutes success, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, echoed Trump’s statement earlier this month mourning the many people who have died. At the same time, she noted in an interview the “economic and emotional boosts for Americans to have local establishments reopen and live professional sports restart following a horrific two months.”  A spokesperson for Anthony Fauci declined to comment on what metrics Fauci would consider a success in beating back the pandemic by November.  Others are trying to sow doubts about the death statistics, which the president has also done. (At the Monday news conference Trump argued that mass quarantine could be killing more people through things like elevated drug use and suicides than the coronavirus.)",1
"New York — Online sales at Target more than doubled as the pandemic put millions in lockdown during the first quarter, revealing further the critical role big box stores played in getting supplies to an immobilized population.  The Minneapolis company reported Wednesday that comparable-store sales, which include online purchases, rose 10.8% for the three-month period that ended May 2.  That was fueled by a 12.5% jump in the number of items customers bought with each trip to the store as families made major restocking runs, but fewer of them.  “Last quarter was unlike anything I have ever seen,” Target's CEO Brian Cornell told reporters on a conference call. “It was intense. It was volatile. It was stressful for our guests and for the country.""  In this April 6, 2020 file photo, a customer wearing a mask carries his purchases as he leaves a Target store during the coronavirus pandemic, in the Brooklyn borough of New York. (Photo: Mark Lennihan, AP)  The pandemic has widened an already growing rift between companies that deftly followed consumers online, and those that have struggled.  J.Crew, Stage Stores, Neiman Marcus, and J.C. Penney have all sought bankruptcy protection in recent weeks.  A years-long campaign by Walmart and Target to challenge Amazon.com online was, as it turns out, a dry run for the pandemic.  Target had already transformed its 1,800 stores into distribution hubs, putting it in a better position than even Amazon.com to keep supplies flowing.  Target's stores were directly involved in supplying goods for 80% of online sales. Same-day services, such as curbside pickup at stores for things ordered online, nearly tripled.  The company has 5 million new users on its website, and 2 million have begun relying on Target's services like curbside pickup for things ordered online.  Target picked up market share in all five of its merchandise categories, Cornell said. Sales of items like furniture and electronics surged 20%. It was the same for groceries.  Clothing sales, a high-margin category for retailers, slipped during the quarter, but that business began to rebound at the tail end of the quarter. Cornell cites government stimulus checks for that late bump in discretionary spending.  It is unclear if other retailers, particularly those that are still closed, saw the same uptick with the arrival of those checks.  As with other retail companies operating in a pandemic, costs soared as well. Target spent and additional $500 million on things directly related to the outbreak. It's bumped up hourly pay for workers by $2. It has now extended emergency pay for those workers to July 4. Target also spent money to sanitize stores and warehouses, new protections for workers an signage for customers to ensure social distancing.  Cornell said those costs will be the new reality going forward.  “There is going to be a premium on creating a safe sanitized shopping environment,"" he said. Shopping while minimizing human contact is the new normal, he said, referring to drive-up and curbside pickup.  Target reported an 11.3% increase in revenue, which hit $19.62 billion for the quarter. Analysts surveyed by FactSet expected $19.02 billion. Net earnings slid 64% to $284 million, or 56 cents, or 59 cents when adjusted for non-recurring events. That's far better than the per-share profit of 44 cents that Wall Street was expecting, according to a survey of analysts by FactSet.

"It’s “one of the most difficult things” for policymakers, said Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. “It’s an impossible balancing task.""  With no easy answers, Europe hasn’t been able to settle on a consistent approach. Germany began reopening schools in April, with older students returning first. In England, it's the opposite, with primary schools poised to begin reopening in June.  In Belgium this week, those in the final years of primary and secondary school began to return to school. Italy and Spain, on the other hand, are treading much more cautiously and only reopening schools in September.  To complicate matters, parents aren’t always on board with their government’s plans. Over 500,000 Britons have signed a petition calling for the right to opt out of sending their children back to school. In Denmark, when schools began to reopen in April, some parents kept their children at home, saying they didn't want them to be “guinea pigs,” Reuters reported.  And it’s not just the children who need to be considered.  “We need to think about the risks of both opening schools and keeping them closed to children, parents, teachers and support staff,” said Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.  What all governments are scrutinizing is the science, which they hope will tell them whether it's safe to reopen schools.  When the coronavirus first emerged, it quickly became clear that children were relatively unscathed.  “In every major country, children have been very little affected by Covid-19 if you looked at the overall picture,” said Viner, speaking at a press briefing on May 13. In China, the U.S., Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the U.K, only around 1 to 2 percent of total coronavirus cases have been in those aged under 18, he noted.  But in late April, as many governments planned their school reopening schedules, there was a new twist: a rare inflammatory disease affecting some children.  The emergence of the syndrome, described as Kawasaki-like, prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare an “urgent need” for more data on the illness. The WHO also said it's “temporarily” linking the syndrome to Covid-19, “based on initial laboratory testing showing positive serology in a majority of patients.”  But to experts such as Viner and Liz Whittaker, clinical lecturer in pediatric infectious diseases and immunology at Imperial College London, the fact that the syndrome is so rare should mean that it shouldn't influence decisions to keep children at home.  “The risk of getting severe COVID-19 in young children remains extremely low, despite this serious condition, which will affect very few,” said Whittaker at the same May 13 briefing. “It shouldn't be a factor ... when decisions are made about when and how to reopen schools.”  Policymakers aren’t just considering whether children get the virus, but how easily they may spread it — a reasonable fear given previous evidence of children being super-spreaders of illnesses such as influenza and measles.  “That’s my biggest fear,” Michael Hoelscher, head of infectious diseases and tropical medicine at Munich University Hospital, told the New York Times.  But the (limited) evidence doesn’t support this.  Ireland’s Health Information and Quality Authority has reviewed the data and found that from the small number of studies identified, “children are not, to date, substantially contributing to the household transmission of SARS-CoV-2.”  The one study that analyzed transmission in schools also showed very low spread, although the review admits that the “evidence remains limited.”      The WHO’s chief scientist, Soumya Swaminathan, told the BBC's ""Andrew Marr Show"" on May 17 that it seemed that “children are less capable of spreading it even if they get the infection.”  But it’s this lack of evidence that was cited by the British Medical Association, the U.K.’s doctors' union, when it supported the country’s National Education Union in its opposition to reopening schools before it deemed it safe to do so, reported the Guardian.  McKee, at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, thinks it is ""premature"" to reopen schools in the U.K. as the country's testing system is “problematic” and its contact-tracing system “untested.”  And some U.K. local authorities are ready to take matters into their own hands and refusing to reopen their schools, just as some mayors in France did earlier in May.  Devi Sridhar, professor and chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, believes that local-level data on levels of transmission and daily new cases is needed to inform these decisions.  “This puts information directly into [the] hands of key members of the educational community,” she wrote on Twitter. “Large national decisions [are] not optimal in these situations given variance within a country.”  When to reopen the schools has been the “most delicate” issue, said Marius Gilbert, head of the Spatial Epidemiology Laboratory at Université Libre de Bruxelles and part of the group advising the Belgian government.  It’s not just the risk of transmission increasing, Gilbert told L’Echo. He warned of another danger – that of children being cut off from all social life and being deprived of the structure that school gives them.  Harry Quilter-Pinner, senior research fellow at the Institute for Public Policy Research, agreed, calling this “probably one of the biggest disruptions we’ve faced in the last 100 years in terms of education and schooling.”  For Quilter-Pinner, the key concern is the widening of the attainment gap, which is the concept that children in deprived areas do worse than their wealthier counterparts.  Indeed, data on England from the Institute for Fiscal Studies finds that during the outbreak, students from wealthier families have been spending more time on home learning and have better access to individualized resources such as private tutoring. Their parents also feel better able to support them.  But the problems don’t stop when schools reopen.  “The challenge of reintroduction is not just how do you get people back into classrooms,” said Quilter-Pinner. “It’s how do you build on what was normal to recover and get back to where we were before.”  Returning to school will require significant logistical challenges, with the need to maintain social distancing and have fewer children in a class, he noted.  “As a society, we have choices to make,” said Quilter-Pinner, such as addressing how big the risk of reopening schools is and whether we are willing to take that risk.  Alastair Sutcliffe, professor of general pediatrics at University College London, said these decisions are based on considerations of “various known risks.”  “One of the few positive things to come out of COVID is that it very rarely kills children, especially very young children, especially healthy young children,” he said, adding that in reopening schools, we need to consider this very low risk versus other potential risks to children from not returning to school.  With no clear end to the pandemic in sight, schools will have to be reopened at some point, say experts like Gilbert at Université Libre de Bruxelles: “In any case, you will have to learn to live with the virus.”  James Randerson and Carmen Paun contributed reporting.

"Almost all 50 states have at least partially reopened their economies as of this week. In Florida, the entertainment and dining complex Disney Springs at Walt Disney World Resort is reopening Wednesday, with safety measures including temperature checks and masks.  Also Wednesday, a Michigan conservative group plans to protest Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's stay-at-home order and the closure of barbershops and salons by giving free haircuts outside the state capitol in Lansing. Meanwhile, Whitmer declared a state of emergency for Midland County and urged residents to evacuate amid heavy flooding.  The U.S. has the largest coronavirus outbreak in the world with roughly 92,000 deaths and 1.5 million confirmed cases, according to the Johns Hopkins University data dashboard.

While overall the April CPI declined 0.8%, consumers on average paid 2.6% more for groceries. It's the largest one-month increase since February 1974. During the last 12 months, grocery prices rose 4.1%.  Price increases in the meat, poultry, fish and egg category were the steepest. Egg prices had the biggest jump as consumers paid 16.1% more in April than in March for eggs. Prices for eggs, according to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) were as high as $3 a dozen in April.  – Susan Selasky  For Instacart shoppers, chance to earn money outweighs coronavirus safety risk  New York's MTA to use UV light to disinfect subways, buses  Transit officials in New York announced a new program to disinfect subways and buses relying on the power of ultraviolet light to kill the new coronavirus.  The Metropolitan Transportation Authority will spend roughly $1 million on 150 UV lamps used to disinfect trains and buses, the agency announced Tuesday.  ""To our knowledge, this is the first reported test of its kind, period,"" Patrick Foye, chairman and CEO of MTA said, per ABC News.  MTA is working with researchers at Columbia University on the project to research how UV light can stop the virus.  'What in God's name is he doing?': Biden rips Trump for saying he uses hydroxychloroquine  Former Vice President Joe Biden criticized President Donald Trump for saying he uses hydroxychloroquine, a drug unproven to treat or prevent the new coronavirus.  ""It's like saying maybe if you injected Clorox into your blood, you know it may cure you. Come on, man. What is he doing? What in God's name is he doing?"" Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, said during a virtual Yahoo News town hall. ""The things the president say, the words of a president, matter.""  Biden worried that people may hear Trump's comments and start using the drug themselves. The Food and Drug Administration has warned against improper use of the drug for COVID-19 outside a hospital or clinical trial setting, citing evidence that the drug could have potentially fatal side effects.  ""Look, this is absolutely irresponsible. There's no serious medical personnel out there saying to use that drug. It's counterproductive. It's not going to help,"" Biden said.  Hydroxychloroquine and coronavirus:Everything to know about the drug Trump says he's taking  After scientist fired, Florida gov. calls coronavirus data manipulation charge a 'nonissue'  Facing an explosive charge that his administration is manipulating coronavirus data to help make the case for reopening Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis played down the controversy Tuesday as a “nonissue.”  The accusations levied by Rebekah Jones, a data expert at the Florida Department of Health, could undercut the governor’s reopening push, which he has called a “safe” and “step by step” approach despite its COVID-19 death toll topping 2,000 Tuesday.  Jones wrote in an email last week that she no longer was overseeing the state’s COVID-19 dashboard, which she built and managed for two months. She wrote that she ""would not expect the new team to continue the same level of accessibility and transparency.""  But DeSantis said at a Tuesday news conference that Jones sent an email to her supervisor saying the comments were being misinterpreted.  Jones told Florida Today that she was fired on Monday. And she said in an email to the CBS12 television station in West Palm Beach that she faced blowback because she refused to ""manually change data to drum up support for the plan to reopen.""  DeSantis spokeswoman Helen Aguirre Ferré, in a separate statement after the news conference, said Jones was fired for ""insubordination.""  – Zac Anderson  CDC quietly releases longer, detailed reopening guidance: reports  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention quietly published a longer 60-page document providing guidance to businesses, restaurants, schools and other establishments on how to reopen while minimizing the risk of spreading the virus, CNN and Politico reported.  The document comes after the agency had released six one-page documents and faced criticism amid reports that the Trump administration shelved the longer, more detailed reopening guidance for being too specific.  Politico and CNN reported Trump administration officials delayed the release of the document because of references to religious organizations that they feared were being unfairly targeted. References to faith-based groups were removed from the final 60-page document, an unnamed CDC official told CNN.  Michigan conservative group to hold 'Operation Haircut' on Capitol lawn  The Michigan Conservative Coalition, an organization intended to shape policy and help more conservatives win election, will hold what it's calling Operation Haircut outside the Capitol on Wednesday. They will protest Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's stay-at-home order and the closing of barbershops and hair salons.  “Michigan’s small business owners are patriotic and law-abiding citizens but enough is enough,” said Marian Sheridan, a co-founder of the group, who added that marijuana dispensaries remain open but ""barber shops are, somehow, unsafe.""  Michigan State Police did not immediately disclose how they would react to the event. Organizers said those attending ""will be encouraged to comply with social distancing and other safe practices,"" such as wearing masks, but people providing haircuts would not be able to remain six feet away from people getting them, as required by the order.  – Todd Spangler, Detroit Free Press  Reopening America: Wednesday brings changes in Connecticut, Kentucky  Connecticut will take its initial steps toward a return to normalcy on Wednesday with some restaurants and retail stores reopening with restrictions, including social distancing and masks.

For Instacart shopper, the chance to earn money outweighs coronavirus safety risk.  Donald Trump calls high number of US coronavirus cases a ‘badge of honor'  President Donald Trump on Tuesday called the number of COVID-19 cases in the United States – the highest in the world – a “badge of honor,” arguing the still-increasing number of cases is simply evidence the country is testing more people.  “By the way, you know, when you say that we lead in cases, that’s because we have more testing than anybody else,” the president said at the White House. “When we have a lot of cases, I don’t look at that as a bad thing. I look at that in a certain respect as being a good thing, because it means our testing is much better. So, if we were testing a million people instead of 14 million people, it would have far few cases, right?""  The U.S. has performed more than 12 million tests, according to the Covid Tracking Project. However, the country still faces testing shortages after months of hurdles in development and access.  – Savannah Behrmann  McDonald's workers in 20 cities set to strike over lack of COVID-19 protections  Hundreds of McDonald’s workers in 20 cities plan to strike Wednesday, the day before the company’s annual shareholders meeting, as part of an effort to pressure the fast-food chain into improving what they say are inadequate protections for employees during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Labor organizers say scores of McDonald's workers in at least 16 states have COVID-19. A survey of more than 800 workers, organizers say, found 42% reported being told not to wear protective gear by management and 46% said they came to work feeling sick because they were afraid they would be disciplined or penalized.  The strike is supported by the Service Employees International Union and is being organized by the ""Fight for $15"" minimum-wage labor campaign.  The company disputes the allegations.  – Brett Schrotenboer  US extends border closures to Canada, Mexico until June 22 amid coronavirus  Travelers looking to make a trip to Canada or Mexico will have to wait another 30 days as the Department of Homeland Security extended border closures to curb COVID-19 infections.  Chad Wolf, the acting Secretary of Homeland Security, announced Tuesday that the U.S.-Canada and U.S.-Mexico land border closure has been extended until June 22.  The U.S. and Canada first limited travel in March for a period of 30 days after President Donald Trump and Trudeau agreed to close the border to help contain the spread of coronavirus. In Mexico, the U.S. limited travel in March for a period of 30 days after Trump said the country agreed to close the border to help stem the spread of the coronavirus.  – Rasha Ali  Pier 1 Imports to shutter all stores  Pier 1 Imports, which previously said it would close half of its stores, now plans to close all of its locations.  The retailer, based in Fort Worth, Texas, announced Tuesday that it was seeking bankruptcy court approval to begin an “orderly wind-down” when stores are able to reopen ""following the government-mandated closures during the COVID-19 pandemic.”  The company says it has approximately 541 U.S. stores. In a court filing, the company says it plans to reopen some stores on or around May 22 for ""store closing efforts and liquidation sales.""  – Kelly Tyko  Mnuchin: 'No workers should give their lives' to boost GDP, stock market  Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said no worker should die in order to boost the U.S. economy. Mnuchin was responding to a question in an exchange with Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, during a hearing on the coronavirus relief legislation.  ""How many workers should give their lives to increase the GDP or the Dow by 1,000 points?"" Brown asked.  ""No workers should give their lives to do that, Senator, and I think your characterization is unfair,"" Mnuchin replied.  Mnuchin also faced sharp questioning from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., about whether companies would have to keep employees on their payrolls if they received aid from a joint Fed-Treasury program. “You’re boosting your Wall Street buddies,"" Warren told the secretary when he declined to comment.  Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testified Tuesday that the Fed and Congress ""may need to do more"" to help revive the economy.  Coronavirus lockdowns have caused a whopping drop in carbon emissions  The coronavirus lockdowns have had an “extreme” effect on daily carbon emissions, causing a whopping 17% drop globally during peak confinement measures by early April – levels last seen in 2006.  However, it is unlikely to last, according to a new analysis by an international team of scientists published in the peer-reviewed British journal Nature Climate Change.  This is the first analysis to measure the pandemic-driven global drop in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from January to April of this year.  While the impact of lockdown measures is likely to lead to the largest annual decrease in emissions since the end of World War II, 2020 is still on track to be one of the five hottest years on record, and the study notes that these reductions are no “silver lining.”  – Doyle Rice  More headlines from USA TODAY:  Contributing: The Associated Press",1
"Uber's food delivery platform is launching a tool that lets families get more value and savings when placing meal orders at a time when more Americans are financially squeezed.  The ride-hailing giant announced the new feature called ""Family Style Meals"" on Wednesday. It's located in the Uber Eats app and features meals meant for sharing.  Some participating restaurants will offer a curated menu that lists a combination of items offering value and savings, the company said. Others will focus primarily on larger portions that can feed multiple members of your family.  ""We know that these are tough times for families, whether they rely on school meals to feed their children or are dealing with the pressures of working from home and cooking three meals a day,"" said Kalyan Kuchimanchi, director of regional operations for the U.S. and Canada at Uber Eats.  Apple is reopening some stores this week:Expect to wear a mask, have temperature checked  McDonald's:Hundreds of chain's workers plan Wednesday strike over COVID-19 protections  Family Meals is launching in select markets to start. Suburbs surrounding New York City, Los Angeles, Atlanta and Miami are among the first to get the update. San Francisco, Washington, Dallas, Boston, and Houston, as well as Connecticut and New Jersey will follow and a full rollout across the country is expected by June.  Also part of Uber's announcement is a free ride donation to local school districts and youth organizations to pass out to food-insecure families. The donation of 100,000 rides is part of a broader 10 million free ride-commitment during the pandemic.  The move comes at a time when millions of Americans have been laid off and had their household income slashed due to the coronavirus fallout. The situation is particularly dire for people with low-wage jobs that cannot be performed at home.  Nearly 37 million Americans were food insecure in 2018. That number could rise by 17.1 million in the wake of the pandemic, according to Feeding America.  Follow Dalvin Brown on Twitter: @Dalvin_Brown",1
"The New York Times has made it abundantly clear that even in the face of massive nursing home death tolls, aided and abetted by the policies of Democrats like Cuomo, Murphy, Whitmer, Newsom, which pursued the lockdown model of clearing out space in hospitals by dumping coronavirus patients into nursing homes, the media will keep on pushing the lockdown lie.  Here's the latest lie.  If the United States had begun imposing social distancing measures one week earlier than it did in March, about 36,000 fewer people would have died in the coronavirus outbreak, according to new estimates from Columbia University disease modelers.  Ah more models. We can never get enough garbage models.  And if the country had begun locking down cities and limiting social contact on March 1, two weeks earlier than most people started staying home, the vast majority of the nation’s deaths — about 83 percent — would have been avoided, the researchers estimated. Under that scenario, about 54,000 fewer people would have died by early May.  54,000 people, 36,000 people. Those are big numbers.  Even small differences in timing would have prevented the worst exponential growth, which by April had subsumed New York City, New Orleans and other major cities, the researchers found. After Italy and South Korea had started aggressively responding to the virus, President Trump resisted canceling campaign rallies or telling people to stay home or avoid crowds. The risk of the virus to most Americans was very low, he said. “Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on,” Mr. Trump tweeted on March 9, suggesting that the flu was worse than the coronavirus. “At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!”  What does any of this have to do with New York, where the leadership, including Bill de Blasio and Andy Cuomo were resisting shutdowns, and where New York City's Health boss was telling people to go to Chinatown and see the parade.  In the New York metro area alone, 21,800 people had died by May 3. Fewer than 4,300 would have died by then if control measures had been put in place and adopted nationwide just a week earlier, on March 8, the researchers estimated.  That would be quite a trick considering the number of nursing home deaths. Access to nursing homes was already restricted. They were locked down. But I'm sure these folks would still be alive if Team Lockdown had locked up more healthy people.  At the 268-bed Cypress Garden Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation in Flushing, 76 patients died from March 1 through May 2, including 68 in April alone, according to internal documents seen by The Post. The state tally is just seven deaths. Department of Health inspectors visited the home this week and the probe is ongoing, the agency said. At Coney Island’s 360-bed Seagate Rehabilitation and Nursing Center, 74 patients died through May 1. The state tally is 25.  If only we had locked up more healthy people and sent more infected people to nursing homes...",0
"Killer hornets threaten US ecosystem  When living in a crisis is a job: lockdown survival tips from seasoned pros. Part 3: Polar Explorer  Home  Stories Post-virus future: 4 trends that will shape the global economy  As the coronavirus pandemic has swept across the world, the media have been rife with predictions of an imminent economic crisis of historic proportions. The scenarios range from apocalyptic to slightly less so, which is understandable, since a cure for COVID-19 has yet to be found, and a vaccine isn't expected any time soon. The more optimistic prognosis envisages this as a chance to remake society and build a better future.  ""The Great Lockdown""  Job seekers visit a National Agency for Employment (Pole Emploi) office in Nice after France reopened its agencies following the outbreak of the coronavirus disease/REUTERS by Eric Gaillard  The IMF predicts that the world will 'very likely' experience the worst recession since the 1930s, and expects the global economy to contract by 3% in 2020, which is a sharp downturn after years of continuous growth. Strict social distancing orders and lockdowns implemented by authorities around the world brought much global economic activity to a halt. The FTSE, Dow Jones and the Nikkei indices have all seen massive falls since the outbreak began. Global trade could, by various estimates, plummet by 13% to 32%, depending on the depth and extent of the crisis.  According to Goldman Sachs, the United States GDP is projected to nosedive by 24% in the second quarter of the year. And when GDP plummets, people lose jobs.  In April the US unemployment rate soared to 14.7%, which is worse than at any time since the Great Depression (and just two months ago it was at 3.5%).  In China, some 80 million people may already be out of work, with more to join them. The pandemic is disrupting global supply chains and international trade and is putting a significant strain on national healthcare systems. Travel restrictions implemented by nearly 100 countries have left tourism, leisure and hospitality sectors, and transportation services in a shambles.  The IMF has dubbed the current crisis ""the Great Lockdown"".  The magnitude and speed of collapse in activity that has followed (the lockdown) is unlike anything we’ve experienced in our lifetimes. Gita Gopinath Chief Economist of the International Monetary Fund  With the global health emergency adding an unprecedented level of uncertainty into the equation, the leading economists and global thinkers map out a new life after the virus. Here are the four principle trends likely to shape the global economy in the post-COVID era.  New isolationism (aka ""islandisation"")  The virus spreads with movement. Since the start of the pandemic, governments have tightened travel regulations between and within countries, which are likely to stay in place with varying degrees of severity at least through the end of the year.  While most epidemiologists agree the current virus outbreak will last between 18 and 24 months, coming back in waves of different intensity, borders can't possibly stay locked for that long.  Many countries are currently preparing to reopen – whether based on improved health data or due to the inability to sustain losses caused by the lockdown/Lei Jiang via Unsplash  To facilitate limited cross-border movement, group-based isolation models are already coming into play. Australia and New Zealand have committed to introducing a trans-Tasmanian ""COVID-safe travel zone"", the Baltic states are creating a ""travel bubble"" for their citizens. In contrast, the European Commission has released guidelines for lifting travel restrictions ""between areas or member states with sufficiently similar epidemiological situations"". Greece, on the other hand, is planning to mandate so-called ""health passports"" for tourists entering the country – such travellers will be waived an otherwise mandatory quarantine. Similar steps will be, likely, taken by other countries in an attempt to renew international travel, yet prevent new virus outbreaks.  These isolation models may result in stratification of society into two groups: those who'd developed immunity and those who haven't.  Speculation about the introduction of the so-called ""immunity passports"" for US citizens have been circulating for quite some time now. Still, civil right activists, including the American Civil Liberties Union – the country's largest civil rights group, – are sceptical about the idea. The thinking behind it is to identify those that could safely return to work and resume travel. This would disproportionately hurt the non-immune population and jeopardise civil rights and liberties – perhaps even tempting some to get sick just to develop anti-bodies and continue with their lives.  Many countries, including the US, have been heavily relying on Chinese imports. /REUTERS by Regis Duvignau  Isolationist tendencies in manufacturing are kicking in as well. Up until now, significant companies organised production using global value chains – that is, relocating production to low wage countries to cut costs. After the economic crisis of 2008/09, global value chain expansion may have come to a halt. However, recent developments revealed many countries, including the US, have been heavily relying on Chinese imports. It became painfully apparent with regards to medical protective equipment.  The Peterson Institute for International Economics suggests in 2018 ""China provided 43 per cent of world imports of face shields, protective garments, mouth-nose-protection equipment, gloves, and goggles"".  The same holds true for electronic components, automotive parts, pharmaceuticals, metals and other supply components imported from China and, to a lesser extent, Taiwan, Mexico and Vietnam.  In the wake of the coronavirus supply chains have been thrown into disarray: logistics became virtually impossible to control, and the prices on specific articles sky-rocketed as components and raw materials became scarce. With the IMF's World Uncertainty Index (WUI) ""three times the size of the uncertainty during the 2002–03 <…> (SARS) epidemic and about 20 times the size during the Ebola outbreak"" many corporations started to consider regionalisation of manufacturing. The US-China trade war has been another factor influencing this decision.  Disruptions introduced by the virus will likely remain a problem even after countries ease lockdowns and restart economic activity, so producing vital goods within national borders will become a priority. This may signal a retreat by global companies in favour of local players. As for export-oriented Asian economies, they may want to turn ""inwards"" catering more to local markets.  Reducing nonessential economic activities and offering added value  The current crisis isn't your ordinary economic crisis. The prescription for solving a regular financial crisis is relatively simple: the government spends and doles out stimulus funding until people start consuming and working again. In the case of the coronavirus crisis, it's health safety first. Therefore, we can't aim at fast economic recovery, as the whole point of quarantine and social distancing is to stop people from going to work and spreading the disease.  The economist James Meadway writes that the correct response to the COVID-19 crisis would not be a massive upscaling of production, but rather a massive scaling back of production.  Being able to reduce output without threatening livelihoods is vital for economies trying to be more resilient to pandemic crises.  This holds true for both the manufacturing and service sectors. Of course, different industries are being affected differently: aviation, tourism, and hospitality are hit the hardest unable to diversify and cope with the lost demand.  A sign at a McDonalds drive-thru advertises free meals for first responders and healthcare workers amid the coronavirus disease /REUTERS by Brian Snyder  Major manufacturing companies, on the other hand – American household goods giant Kimberly-Clark and Coca-Cola with dozens of brand names under the belt, – are limiting the number of products they make, focusing on the ones in highest demand. Scalability, as well as the potential for diversification, will be a bonus: the UK Royal Mint, for instance, started producing medical visors for hospital use, while Dyson and many other manufacturers are producing ventilators or PPE. Being able to provide added value is also important: in the US national fast-food chains like McDonald's and Subway started to offer free delivery, others introduced everyday grocery items along with their menu staples.  Fast technological advances  Robotic automation and artificial intelligence (AI) will be crucial for the success of supply chains as they help reduce the need for humans to work face to face. With changing modes of consumption and interaction, more and more businesses will go ""digital first"".  After the coronavirus has been tamed, many former office workers will continue to work from home, as this model has proved successful and less costly.  Technological and mental barriers that made a presence on-site essential have been overcome – this is, in fact, one of the significant effects the pandemic has had on the work scene.  ""I imagine the pandemic will speed up the development of the infrastructure needed to support our online work,"" says Susan Schneider, director of the ""AI, Mind and Society Group"" at The University of Connecticut, adding she's worried that ""…in a post-pandemic world, corporations may make less use of human labour, replacing human workers with automation and AI. Computers and robots don't get sick.""  A Japanese girl making friends with a robot at Kuromon Ichiba Market, Ōsaka-shi, Japan/Andy Kelly via Unsplash  Whether humans will remain the dominant workforce or not, remote work and learning that require connectivity and access to online resources, the increase in the number of online payments and day-to-day operations will make us even more dependent on tech companies.  Unmanned aerial vehicles, 'telehealth' and new space technologies are gaining momentum, moving from the realm of science fiction into the mainstream.  While some sectors of the economy will never be the same again, new ones will gain popularity and attract investments, among them security services, independent communication systems, and self-sustaining housing solutions.  Stronger government involvement in social and economic life  During the COVID-19 crisis, the role of government has undergone a dramatic change. Nations are looking to their respective governments to mobilise medical resources, implement containment measures and offer financial help. Free market solutions aiming at making a profit rather than catering to the public good aren't much help when millions of people lose their livelihood overnight. The American government is offering small business loans and direct payments to a vast number of people. Apart from that, the Senate promised to pay $50 billion in bailouts to airlines and $130 billion in aid to hospitals. Germany will spend some €40 billion to bolster small businesses, and in Denmark, the government is ready to cover 75-90 percent of salaries if companies do not lay off their employees. But unprecedented help comes with unprecedented control.  A Colombian police officer operates a drone that measures body temperature, in an area of high contagion amid the coronavirus disease in Bogota, Colombia /REUTERS by Luisa Gonzalez  Both democratic and authoritarian regimes imposed quarantines, closed borders and implemented a variety of stringent measures. In the streets of China, drones search for people without face masks and chastise them over loudspeakers. In Israel, the national security agency is now allowed to access infected individuals' phone records. The UK's recently passed coronavirus bill gives police and immigration officers the right to arrest suspected virus carriers and have them tested. Germany, Austria, Italy, and Belgium use data from major telecommunication companies to track people's movement. The list goes on and on.  Shoshana Zuboff, the author of ""The Age of Surveillance Capitalism"" believes a pandemic is a perfect chance for governments to start monitoring their citizens more closely.  Measures that were once viewed as emergency ones may become a permanent rollback of civil rights.  Liberally-minded folks who fear this scenario are particularly concerned that, given the currently prescribed social distancing, activism has been reduced to ""clicktivism"". That means sitting at home on social media feeds and venting online, instead of rallying and being engaged in other forms of political protest.  When it comes to the economy, a certain degree of government intervention may not be such a terrible idea, as argued by free-market zealots. The Spanish flu of 1918 was, after all, a catalyst in the development of public health systems across quite a few countries, as many governments embraced the concept of socialised medicine.  For the last 25-30 years the most developed countries have been cutting down on public health programmes, and the current pandemic will perhaps encourage some to rethink their approach.  Speaking about scenarios global economies might be pressured to follow after the pandemic, analyst Simon Meir uses terms ""State capitalism"" and ""State socialism"". The first model being predominantly concerned with pursuing exchange value, and the second – with protecting life itself rather than protecting markets. The extreme version of the latter would involve nationalisation of healthcare, food and energy production and, perhaps, providing free housing. State capitalism, on the other hand, doesn't allow for extensive state intervention into the economy, apart from short-term loans for saving businesses. The author, however, points out that these models are likely ""to bleed into one another"". And this is what we're currently witnessing, with the pro-market Trump administration openly talking about taking stakes in airlines, oil and defence companies in exchange for grants.  The pandemic has opened a window to creating new ways and institutions to deal with the suffering, including more effective measures to stop the trend toward greater inequality. Robert J. Shiller Winner of the 2013 Nobel Prize in economics  Well, crises do shape history. Hopefully, this one doesn't go to waste.",0
"More than half a century ago a fellow grad student invited me into his laboratory to show me his doctoral research. He introduced me to the science of animal reflexes. A novel stimulus induces in an animal, however briefly, a freeze reaction. This is called an “orienting reflex.” What happens next depends on the animal’s response to the potential threat. If the novel stimulus does not seem to be a threat the animal gradually relaxes. Repeats of this type of stimulus gradually habituate its orienting reflex so that the animal, in effect, learns to ignore this particular stimulus.  On the other hand, in the case of a real threat, the animal can only respond in one of two ways: It can freeze for an extended length of time or it can panic and run to escape.  Humans, too, experience the orienting freeze reflex to novel stimuli. If the stimulus is a threat, a person may freeze in place for a substantial time, or the person may flee in panic. Or, and this is what makes humans different from all animals, some people may become coldly rational and plan out, and execute, an appropriate course of action. Training, especially, helps create this rational response.  The important thing to note is that the orienting reflex is so essential to survival that it evolved very early in the history of life. Its creation was back so deep in time that we share the orienting reflex with insects, with spiders, and with even more primitive creatures.  Society emulates an organism. An animal is a collection of functioning elements, all working in cooperation. It is useful to consider a society, such as America, as a kind of organism analogous to an animal. Individual people make up the cooperating functional elements of society. I postulate that our society has an orienting reflex, as well.  Consider the response of America to Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor: Shock! Freeze! Anger! That was the first orienting response. Then, since we are human, came coldly rational plans, then fully unified action to destroy this threat to our existence. Consider America’s first response to 9-11. Initially it was the same, but soon different factions chose to use the event to promote their ideologies. Instead of unity we had disunity. America has changed — and not for the better.  Think of America’s response to COVID-19. We indeed have had the orienting reflexive freeze. What is this new threat? We wondered. What are its characteristics? What should we know about it? Because of the novelty of this virus we knew too little to make rational plans. Our natural reaction was to continue the orienting freeze reflex until we could find a way to defeat it.  We did know at the beginning a few things about this new disease: We knew that this virus is exceptionally contagious. One thing we thought we knew (but maybe were wrong about) was that this virus is exceptionally deadly. The thing we were certain of was that a really serious pandemic would overload our medical facilities. Rational response required a temporary lockdown to “flatten the curve” so as to not overload our medical establishment. This we did — successfully.  But then politics intervened — big time! There are people in our society who lust for power and luxuriate in it once they have it. Some are elected, many are not. Call them governors, call them mayors, call them health administrators, call them bureaucrats, call them “journalists,” the power mad have become a potentially lethal plague on America. They have suspended our civil liberties “for the duration.”  So what is the duration? These power-mad people have moved the goal posts to the undeterminable far future when a vaccine cure will be available. There has never been a successful vaccine for an upper respiratory corona virus. So don’t count on it this time. If we do get one an instant Nobel prize awaits. Waiting for a vaccine is just an excuse for continued suppression of our liberties. Moving the goal posts is profoundly dishonest and un-American.  In the name of “science” some governors forbade experimentation with various pharmaceutical treatments. When President Trump suggested that early experiments indicated that a combination of hydroxychloroquine, zinc and azithromycin was effective in stopping an early stage infection, the Left: left academics, left “journalists,” left bureaucrats, and left politicians, went berserk: Politics (I spit the word out)!  It is commonplace to say that the pandemic is a science problem. No it is not! Science has to do with fundamental understanding. Figuring out the molecular action of this coronavirus is science. Defeating the pandemic is not science. Defeating the pandemic is engineering!  When I was just starting my career as an engineering physicist I was told a story. The story is likely apocryphal, but it illustrates the profound difference between science and engineering: One day the ancient Romans decided to bring fresh water down from the mountains to the city. Naturally they hired the best hydraulic specialists — the Greeks — the masters of the science of hydrostatics. The Greeks said that the pressure in a tall waterpipe would be very great. They were right, of course. Therefore, buttress the outside of your filled pipes, they advised, to prevent their explosion. The Romans did as suggested. However, when the water started to flow the pipes imploded instead of exploded. No one knew why this happened. The Romans simply shrugged their shoulders and buttressed the inside of these water pipes — with great success. About two thousand years later the Bernoulli brothers found the scientific explanation. So, science is nice, but engineering works.  Who are the engineers in this pandemic? The doctors on the front line, of course. These are the pragmatic guys who are willing to try anything to save the lives of their patients — even if the academic scientists say don’t. Let’s also give credit to the hands-on lab scientists who are working, often with great ingenuity, to find a vaccine. That too is engineering, only at the molecular level.  Now that the pandemic is easing up a bit I was able to chat about this with a highly regarded infectious medicine specialist. This is a man who once saved my life by working in his lab to devise an antibiotic cocktail for me. This, after all conventional treatments had failed. This good doctor has spent almost every waking hour of the last two months saving the lives of COVID patients, some of whom were in intensive care. He has found that the hydroxychloroquine cocktail works with patients in the early to mid-phase of infection, but not much in the intensive care phase. He uses other techniques in the late phase. His experience with the cocktail corresponds to that of other doctors. The hydroxy cocktail is therefore a very effective prophylactic, or curative, depending on the stage of infection. But not later on.  When I mentioned the notion that, in this pandemic, he was an engineer, not a scientist, he most emphatically agreed. Then this mild mannered man surprised me by using very strong language with respect to the “science” advisors to the politicians.  Science has its place. Ultimately we will understand this new contagion and eliminate its threat. In the meantime, it is the medical engineers who are the key to defeating this invader: the medical doctors on the front line; the people working on vaccines and other medications. And, of equally great importance, let us not forget the business owners, small and large, who are the engineers of our economy. All these practical people should be the ones guiding society back to normality — not the power hungry politicians and, most especially, not the technocrat “scientists.”",0
"(Natural News) Thereâs no better way to get the stock market climbing again than to pump billions of emergency taxpayer dollars into vaccine companies, while cutting safety regulations for new cell-manipulating, gene-altering biologics. This is exactly what President Donald Trump, the FDA, and the federal coronavirus task force seem to be doing. They are fast-tracking experimental injections through clinical trials so they can be distributed en masse with the assistance of the U.S. military.  The federal government is hastening the scientific process and therefore polluting and corrupting it. The President’s âwarp speedâ demands for mass-produced biologics will inevitably cause unintended consequences, as biologics are unavoidably unsafe. (1 Bruesewitz v. Wyeth LLC)  These inevitable vaccine injuries will no doubt be swept under the rug and be handled by the Department of Health and Human Services and the special master of the Vaccine Court. This system was set up in 1988 to pay off select families of vaccine-injured children while granting vaccine makers legal immunity, preserving faulty vaccine supply. To make matters worse, the HHS has recently admitted in court that the lawfully required safety studies have not been conducted to improve vaccine safety over the past thirty-two years.  To heighten the coercion, several governors have announced extended state-wide lockdowns and restrictions, claiming that there will be no going back to normal until a vaccine or pharmaceutical is widely available. This is medical coercion empowered by the force of government â the likes of which the world has not witnessed since the rise of the Nazis. Not only is the scientific process being bastardized, but state governments are being used to punish certain businesses and suppress the people, to coerce the population to comply with upcoming, fast-tracked biologics and gene therapy injections.  The vaccine that the world is being held hostage for is coming along great â WAIT A MINUTE!  On January 11, Chinese authorities shared a genetic sequence of novel coronavirus with US vaccine company, Moderna. Just two days later, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NSAID) finalized the sequence for mRNA-1273, allowing Moderna to manufacture the sequence for clinical trials. The NSAID is governed by Dr. Anthony Fauci, the lead spokesman for the federal coronavirus task force, and the same man who helped fund the Wuhan Institute of Virology where China conducted controversial research on bats and coronavirus gain-of-function.  This sequence is not the only coronavirus mutation identified by scientists. This year, there have been over thirty coronavirus mutations identified, each circulating in different hemispheres and regions, eliciting various viral loads and gain-of-function properties, causing various symptoms, ranging from a mild cold to symptoms much more severe.  On March 23, it was declared that the vaccine wouldnât be commercially available for 12 to 18 months; however, Moderna announced that it could be available for âemergency useâ before the end of the year. Moderna was then awarded hundreds of millions of dollars to enable large scale production of mRNA-1273. The company announced a worldwide collaboration with a biotechnology company named Lonza, to manufacture up to 1 billion doses of mRNA-1273 per year.  Now, this is a new kind of vaccine that inserts lab-grown genetic RNA material into your body, forcing an invasion into your cells. After the RNA material invades your cells and hijacks your cell’s ribosomes, it forces the cells to produce viral components such as the iconic spike protein. This vaccine-augmented, self-replicating spike protein, produced within the cells, is intended to train the immune system to fight. This manipulation of cellular protein encoding will never be adequately studied for safety in clinical trials, for it’s real effects can only be observed in the population over time.  The government and the vaccine makers have already prepared this biological preparation for mass distribution long before it had ever been researched through any credible scientific process, long before it had ever passed any serology efficacy test, or passed any animal safety tests, including primate and ferret studies. In tests on guinea pigs, 20 percent suffered serious reactions within 43 days, mirroring similar results that were obtained on the infamous SARS vaccine trials that caused pulmonary immunopathology in animals upon subsequent infection.  This new RNA sequence is currently being tested on people and rushed through human clinical trials so it can be released onto populations that are currently being coerced to accept a ânew normalâ until this cell-hijacking, gene-altering Holy Grail vaccine is available.  According to the pharmaceutical-funded media, this Holy Grail has passed through Phase 1 with flying colors. The RNA viral sequence and its accompanying formulation (undisclosed) has elicited an immune response in a small group of human participants between the ages of 18 and 55 years. This vague news has caused the companyâs stock valuation to surge to 29 billion, an astonishing valuation for a company that currently sells zero products.  Moderna is using the pharmaceutical-funded media to their advantage, blitzing the media with corporate success talk but providing little data on real life efficacy and safety. How will this hijacking of cellular protein production and forced augmentation of antibodies hold up over time and how does it affect human DNA?  Scientists at the NSAID, who developed the vaccine prototype, are usually quick to advertise their successes. They have made no comment on the phase 1 trial and are currently quiet on the matter. Moderna, on the other hand, trumpeted their phase 1 results, watching their stock market valuation soar. Their press release praised the development of âbinding antibodiesâ and omitted the fact that only eight out of forty-five vaccine recipients have so far developed neutralizing antibodies â the kind that are needed. The antibody assessment comes after participants received two doses of the vaccines and had their blood tested two weeks later. The researchers will never know if these antibodies are durable, whether they will convey any form of short or long-standing immunity. Moreover, this new RNA encoding and its artificial augmentation of an immune response could have repercussions as the immune system could attack the body’s own cells. Could these RNA messenger immune augmentations ultimately generate strong type I interferon responses, leading to chronic inflammation and inflammatory conditions?  âI would like to see the data to make my own interpretation of the data,â said Anna Durbin, a vaccine researcher at Johns Hopkins University. âBut I think it is at least encouraging that weâve seen immune responses with this RNA vaccine that we havenât seen with previous RNA vaccines for other pathogens. Whether itâs going to be enough, we donât know.â Two weeks is very early, she said. âWe donât know if those antibodies are durable.â  Upon further investigation, the vaccine appears to trigger the production of âbinding antibodiesâ that foreshadow the âpathogenic primingâ that caused deaths in early SARS coronavirus vaccine experiments that failed to come to market during the 2002-2003 outbreak. Moreover, there is a 20% percent âseriousâ injury rate among the extremely healthy volunteers in the high dose group, which elicited medical intervention or hospitalization. Moderna has not disclosed whether the immune response they measured was more prevalent in the young or the old. Lastly, Moderna has not disclosed whether the immune response they measured is harmful upon subsequent infection, is capable of causing autoimmune issues, or causes damage to cellular processes that cannot be undone.

"Visit our Re-post guidelines This article is copyrighted by GreenMedInfo LLC, 2020  A new bill has been introduced into the 116th Congress (2019-2020) of the U.S. House of Representatives named H.R.6666 - COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act, with the potential to further the loss of the already vanishing health freedoms of each and every citizen of the United States. You can stand with us today by opposing H.R.6666 now (use this link to Take A Stand)  H.R. 6666, despite having been introduced by Rep. Bobby L. Rush [D-IL-1] and referred to the Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on the same day almost two weeks ago on 5/01/2020, has received little mainstream media coverage to this date, other than recent attempts to debunk claims that it would further violate the rights of Americans. As of 5/14/2020 is has 59 co-sponsors, including one Republican, indicating the potential that it may gain greater bipartisan support unless strongly opposed.  H.R. 6666 authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the CDC, to allocate a 100 billion dollars, annually (or until the national COVID emergency is declared over), to employ, train, and deploy an immense workforce of “testing and contact tracers” to be sent directly to everyone’s homes for diagnostic testing and tracing of contacts suspected to have been infected or are at risk of infection with COVID-19. The bill uses broad yet highly vague language to describe the role of this veritable army of new agents of the emerging U.S. medical police state “for other purposes,” such as “support the quarantine of such contacts.”  The nebulous language of H.R. 6666 affords the government and public and private grantees under its coordination unusually broad discretion to apply its newly granted police powers under the presently defined “national COVID health emergency.” Since the national lockdown began on March the 15th, we’ve witnessed the near complete suspension of most of our Constitutionally irrevocable civil liberties, with the near complete cessation and/or modification of all socio-economic activity within the country. Moreover, executive orders have already been enacted throughout this country enabling the forced seizure of body tissue and fluids, property, forced vaccination, testing, isolation, quarantine and arrest without due process. While not all of these draconian regulations have yet been implemented en masse, they exist in the letter of the law and therefore could be enforced, especially given that bills such as H.R.6666 use broad discretionary language leaving it to the government to intepret its meaning and apply force as it sees fit. If H.R. 6666 passes, real ""teeth"" would be put to many of the laws, acts, orders, and regulations that have been passed as executive orders over the past two months, potentially locking the entire country into an irreversible control grid the likes of which we have not seen outside of countries like China.  In light of this, H.R. 6666 may be setting the stage for the implementation of what WHO director Dr. Mike Ryan of the WHO and Ventura County California officials, say will include forcibly removing family members found positive or suspected of being infected. The only way to prevent this is to make sure the bill is opposed and dies.  Eligible recipients of funds include “faith-based” and “school-based” institutions, implying that these organizations might also become, in part, testing or treatment centers.  What is Contract Tracing?  Take a few minutes to watch the important reports by independent journalists Spyro Skouras and James Corbett on the contact tracing agenda in the rapidly unfolding story of coronavirus.  Contract tracing, which on the surface appears to mitigate the risk of disease spread by identifying carriers and interfering their further contact with the healthy, is based on a series of flawed assumptions:  The disease known as COVID-19 and believed to be caused by a singular infectious disease entity, i.e. the viral particle known as SARS-CoV-2, has never been validated through Koch postulates to be inducible and solely caused by SARS-CoV-2 within a controlled clinical or experimental setting. Over 100 different types of coronavirus have already been identified in circulation naturally around the world, and there is serious doubt that we can adequately distinguish between natural extracellular vesicles such as human exosomes and novel or endogenous forms of coronovirus already present in the human virome with the tests being used today, namely, RT-PCR. Learn more about this at www.questioningcovid.com That so-called “positive cases” identified through any number of over 100 different PCR-based and antibody-testing methods are accurate indicators of the presence of COVID-19, or do not generate false positives. If false positives are not accounted for, contract tracing can cause or contribute to a falsely expanding epidemic and those who are unnecessarily quarantined and treated will succumb to greatly elevated iatrogenically induced morbidity and mortality risks, which will never be discovered because the so-called “confirmed case fatality rates for COVID-19” require no viral testing, and only “suspicion of infection.” This is because the WHO and US Vital Statistics agencies explicitly advise against confirming these suspicion-based deaths through viral testing and other clinical means, in an egregious departure from both science and evidence-based medicine.  If contact tracing is fraught with technical inadequacies, why would it be so aggressively implemented nationwide? One reason is that it provides a justification for total spectrum dominance via real-time surveillance and control of the entire population under the auspices of “public health safety,” into perpetuity. In essence, it is like a new “war on terror,” but with the enemy being defined as our own bodies, or contact between bodies, and the solution the complete removal of any privacy, nor right to exempt oneself or children from medical mandates. The system would likely include tracking GPS data of mobile device users and then following back their contacts to identify, test, isolate, quarantine, medicate, or otherwise vaccinate them when one becomes available most likely in the fall of 2020. The media has already fomented profound fear through misreporting, misrepresenting, and catastrophizing case fatality projections, over the past few months. Their egregious disregard for the truth has lead to socioenomic and psychobiological impacts that are arguably orders of magnitude more harmful and deadly than this, or any other virus believed to contribute to flu-like illness. Clearly, the media and power that be could re-manufacture another crisis, or “second” or “third” wave simply be repeating what they have already one (learn more on the topic via the Corbett Report). At which point, with an army of contact tracers, testers, quarantine enforcers, and medicators and vaccinators, the systems being funded by H.R. 6666 would be ready to further this agenda.  So, why does H.R. 6666 refrain from providing even the most rudimentary details to how one of the largest and most widespread in impact bills ever introduced will impact those affected? The more vague and broad the language, the less oversight. The truth is that the detailed plans for how H.R.666 will be implemented were already written and revealed to the public a month ago by the Rockefeller Foundation in a 30-page plan titled, “NATIONAL COVID-19 TESTING ACTION PLAN:Pragmatic steps to reopen our workplaces and our communities.” Not coincidentally, the plan proposed the exact same dollar figure was required - 100 billion dollars -- and suggested that between 100-300,000 contract tracers would be needed.

"Another 46 Los Angeles County residents have died after testing positive for the coronavirus, officials announced Thursday, May 21, pushing the county’s death toll above 2,000.  The number of fatalities linked to the coronavirus as of Thursday was 2,016.  “This is a very sad milestone for us. To those of you suffering and grieving,” the county’s Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said during a Thursday afternoon briefing, “we offer our deepest condolences. We are thinking of you and your families every single day.”  The county also announced 1,204 new cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, bringing the total number of infections so far to 42,307.  The mid-day total did not include updated numbers for Pasadena and Long Beach. Both cities have their own health departments, unlike every other city in the county, and have been managing their own local response to COVID-19. Long Beach reported three new deaths, bringing the city’s total to 68, and 95 new cases for a total of 1,495. Pasadena reported six new cases, for a total of 790 and two new deaths, for a total of 79.  Of the newly reported deaths in LA County, 28 were over the age of 65, 20 of whom had underlying health conditions; 12 were between the ages of 41 and 65, 10 of whom had underlying health conditions. County officials did not have details on the six remaining fatalities other than to say three occurred in Long Beach, and the other three happened in Pasadena.  Of all of the people who have died in the county from coronavirus-related causes, about 39% were Latino, 29% were white, 17% were Asian, 12% were African American, 1% were Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander and 1% identified as another race.  About 92% of people who have died after testing positive for COVID-19 have had underlying health conditions.  More than 403,000 COVID-19 tests have been administered in the county, Ferrer said, and about 9% of those people have tested positive for the virus.  As Los Angeles County moves forward with lifting closures that were intended to stem the spread of the coronavirus, Ferrer said officials are keeping a close eye on the number of cases and deaths, as well as indicators like hospital capacity and the availability of personal protective equipment for frontline workers.  Most of those measures are headed in the right direction, she said. The transmission rate has declined from one person with the virus infecting about three other people to one person with the virus infecting one other person on average, she said.  “This is very good news, and it shows that what we’re doing over past few weeks — staying home, physical distancing, wearing our cloth face coverings — has resulted in a reduced number of infections from what we would have had had we not taken any action.”  The average number of deaths per day is also shrinking, and officials are meeting their target for contact tracing, which is to follow up with every new case within one day of receiving that information, Ferrer said.  “As a community, we’ve done this together,” she said, “and this progress is a direct reflection of what all of you in your day-to-day lives have been able to accomplish.”  Moving forward, she said, it will be important for people to continue taking those precautions as they take advantage of opportunities to get outside.  “As we hike our trails, go to our beaches and use our other outdoor spaces, we can all take responsibility for creating safety for the people who work at those sites and others who are using these spaces,” she said. “I know we can do this. Of this I’m certain because we’ve done it. We’ve worked together. We’ve been doing our part, and we’ve saved lives as a result.”",1

"The chief scientist brought on to lead the Trump administration’s vaccine efforts has spent the last several days trying to disentangle pieces of his stock portfolio and his intricate ties to big pharmaceutical interests, as critics point to the potential for significant conflicts of interest.  The scientist, Moncef Slaoui, is a venture capitalist and a former longtime executive at GlaxoSmithKline. Most recently, he sat on the board of Moderna, a Cambridge, Mass., biotechnology firm with a $30 billion valuation that is pursuing a coronavirus vaccine. He resigned when President Trump named him last Thursday to the new post as chief adviser for Operation Warp Speed, the federal drive for coronavirus vaccines and treatments.  Just days into his job, the extent of Dr. Slaoui’s financial interests in drug companies has begun to emerge: The value of his stock holdings in Moderna jumped nearly $2.4 million, to $12.4 million when the company released preliminary, partial data from an early phase of its candidate vaccine trial that helped send the markets soaring on Monday.  Dr. Slaoui sold his shares on Tuesday, and the administration said he would donate the increased value to cancer research.  But the Moderna stock is just one piece of his pharmaceutical portfolio, much of which is not public. And some ethics and financial securities experts have voiced concerns about the arrangement Dr. Slaoui struck with the administration. – READ MORE  Listen to the insightful Thomas Paine Podcast Below --",0
"A Reuters/Ipsos poll published Thursday has revealed that a quarter of Americans are not interested in taking a coronavirus vaccine.  The poll founds that 14% were not interested at all, and 10% were not very interested in the vaccine.  However, while that 24% dismissed the idea, two thirds, 66%, said they are either “very” or “somewhat” interested in taking a vaccine when it is produced.  Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, said “It’s a little lower than I thought it would be with all the attention to COVID-19,” adding “I would have expected somewhere around 75 percent.”  The Reuters report notes that health experts believe “at least 70% of Americans would need to be immune through a vaccine or prior infection to achieve what is known as “herd immunity,” when enough people are resistant to an infectious disease to prevent its spread.”  Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine noted that “It’s not surprising a significant percentage of Americans are not going to take the vaccine because of the terrible messaging we’ve had, the absence of a communication plan around the vaccine and this very aggressive anti-vaccine movement.”  The poll also found that 36% of respondents would be less willing to take a vaccine if President Trump said it was safe, with just 14% said they would be interested.  A week ago, Trump announced “Operation Warp Speed,” to fast-track the development and distribution of a coronavirus vaccine by January 2021, tapping experts and resources in science, medicine, the military, and the private sector.  Trump has said that the military will be deployed to distribute the vaccine, but has suggested that it will remain voluntary, noting that it will be for those “who want to get it,” and “Not everyone is going to want to get it.”  We are now accepting pre-orders for our healthy and delicious storable food.

"This week, the president of the United States not only revealed that he has been taking an anti-malaria hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) drug as a precautionary measure against COVID-19, but he also slammed a study warning about the dangers of its use. New research has now emerged that might soon become a further target for Donald Trump's ire.  A new observational study conducted among more than 96,000 patients diagnosed with coronavirus and treated with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine concluded that the usage of these drugs was associated with a higher risk of death or development of hearth arrhythmias among recipients, according to the medical journal The Lancet that published the research.  “We were unable to confirm a benefit of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, when used alone or with a macrolide, on in-hospital outcomes for COVID-19”, the study’s authors wrote. “Each of these drug regimens was associated with decreased in-hospital survival and an increased frequency of ventricular arrhythmias when used for treatment of COVID-19”.  The observed patients, hospitalised between 20 December 2019 and 14 April 2020, were recruited from 671 hospitals in six continents and divided into five groups: those who did not receive any treatment by these drugs (control group), those who were treated with hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine alone, and those who received any of these drugs in combination with macrolide (antibiotic).  The researchers found that the mortality rate was the highest among those 6,221 patients who received hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide (23.8%), while the treatment of coronavirus with hydroxychloroquine alone in a group comprising 3,016 patients resulted in an 18% death rate. Those 8% of patients combining HCQ with antibiotics were also more likely to develop a heart arrhythmia, the study argues.  Meanwhile, around 1 in 6 patients treated with chloroquine (16.4%) and 22.2% of those who combined it with an antibiotic died during the study.  © REUTERS / Reuters Photographer A nurse shows a pill of hydroxychloroquine, amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, at Nossa Senhora da Conceicao hospital in Porto Alegre, Brazil, April 23, 2020  In comparison, only 1 in 11 hospitalised patients from the control group fell victim to coronavirus during this period. However, to be fair, the control group was the largest one observed in the study, covering more than 80,000 patients, around 7,546 of whom died.  These results prompted scientists to conclude that the treatment of coronavirus with HCQ was not really beneficial.  “Previous small-scale studies have failed to identify robust evidence of a benefit and larger, randomised controlled trials are not yet completed”, said the study’s co-author, Dr. Frank Ruschitzka, as cited by CNN. “However, we now know from our study that the chance that these medications improve outcomes in COVID-19 is quite low”.  This research was published shortly after US President Donald Trump revealed this week that he was taking HCQ as a precautionary measure against coronavirus, despite warnings from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) about the risks of doing so outside of a hospital setting and without proper vetting from health authorities. Hydroxychloroquine has been widely used in America for the treatment of malaria, lupus and some other diseases upon prescription for more than six decades, however its utility for the treatment of coronavirus is at best unproven.  “That was a false study done. Where they gave it to very sick people. Extremely sick people. People that were ready to die. It was given by obviously not friends of the administration”, Trump said during a cabinet meeting on Tuesday.  The US president still insists that the use of HCQ to fight COVID-19 is a ""game changer” and he slammed an earlier non-peer reviewed study that found a link between the use of the antimalaria drug and an increasing number of deaths among corona-stricken veterans.",0
"On Thursday, Trump also floated a potential move by his administration to reopen houses of worship in the near future.  “The churches are not being treated with respect by a lot of Democratic governors,” Trump said as he left the White House to visit a ventilator factory in Michigan. “I want to get our churches open. We will take a very strong position on that very soon.”  Some Trump allies have attributed the recent slump in the president’s support to the closure of churches that Trump addressed on Friday. Social-distancing guidelines forced most churches to suspend in-person worship or move Sunday services into the virtual sphere, and one member of the Trump campaign’s “Evangelicals for Trump” coalition suggested that faith leaders and parishioners who have been frustrated by the limitations are mistakenly blaming Trump. (Religious institutions in Kentucky, Texas, Virginia, Tennessee, Louisiana and California have all brought legal challenges against their states for restrictions on religious activities and gatherings.)  “Those who don’t understand the legalities of the process could be blaming the president or the administration when the federal government is dealing with states’ rights issues,” said Mark Burns, a South Carolina pastor and prominent Trump supporter.  It was not immediately clear whether the president's order on Friday — that state and local officials must take immediate action to reopen religious institutions — was legally permissible, nor was it clear how administration officials planned to enforce the guidance.  Guidelines released this week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about reopening certain establishments — including schools, public transit systems and child care facilities — did not mention how religious institutions should go about returning to in-person worship services and ministry opportunities. One senior administration official said the guidance was omitted due to concerns that the prescriptions CDC staffers planned to provide were too restrictive.  It’s unlikely that critics of church closings alone are responsible for the decline in Trump’s favorability among critical religious demographics. According to the Pew survey, 43 percent of white evangelicals and 52 percent of white Catholics think the current restrictions on public activity in their areas are appropriate versus 42 percent and 31 percent, respectively, who think fewer restrictions would be better. Greater shares of white evangelicals and white Catholics also said they are more afraid about their state governments lifting restrictions on public activity too soon than they are about leaving the restrictions in place for too long.  As the coronavirus-related death toll approaches 100,000 and outbreaks emerge in locations where social distancing is more difficult, Laura Gifford, a historian of politics and religion at George Fox University, said it’s likely become harder for the president’s supporters to embrace his plans for an accelerated reopening of the country. The more Trump contradicts health officials who have warned against reopening schools and nonessential businesses, she suggested, the less accepting his usual supporters might become of his overall response.  “If grandma’s retirement home is suffering from an outbreak, there’s pretty good evidence that something is awry and it makes it difficult to ignore what public health experts are saying,” Gifford said. “This is something where that is harder to ignore than previous controversies or crises because it has life-and-death consequences for congregations and religious populations.”  Part of the strategy Trump allies have adopted to protect his relationship with conservative Christians is to frame the novel coronavirus — and church closures in response to social distancing restrictions — as a threat to religious freedom. The president’s religious supporters routinely cite religious liberty as one of their top priorities and an area in which they believe the Trump administration has been exceptionally receptive.",0
"Visit our Re-post guidelines This article is copyrighted by GreenMedInfo LLC, 2020  A new bill has been introduced into the 116th Congress (2019-2020) of the U.S. House of Representatives named H.R.6666 - COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act, with the potential to further the loss of the already vanishing health freedoms of each and every citizen of the United States. You can stand with us today by opposing H.R.6666 now (use this link to Take A Stand)  H.R. 6666, despite having been introduced by Rep. Bobby L. Rush [D-IL-1] and referred to the Referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on the same day almost two weeks ago on 5/01/2020, has received little mainstream media coverage to this date, other than recent attempts to debunk claims that it would further violate the rights of Americans. As of 5/14/2020 is has 59 co-sponsors, including one Republican, indicating the potential that it may gain greater bipartisan support unless strongly opposed.  H.R. 6666 authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the CDC, to allocate a 100 billion dollars, annually (or until the national COVID emergency is declared over), to employ, train, and deploy an immense workforce of “testing and contact tracers” to be sent directly to everyone’s homes for diagnostic testing and tracing of contacts suspected to have been infected or are at risk of infection with COVID-19. The bill uses broad yet highly vague language to describe the role of this veritable army of new agents of the emerging U.S. medical police state “for other purposes,” such as “support the quarantine of such contacts.”  The nebulous language of H.R. 6666 affords the government and public and private grantees under its coordination unusually broad discretion to apply its newly granted police powers under the presently defined “national COVID health emergency.” Since the national lockdown began on March the 15th, we’ve witnessed the near complete suspension of most of our Constitutionally irrevocable civil liberties, with the near complete cessation and/or modification of all socio-economic activity within the country. Moreover, executive orders have already been enacted throughout this country enabling the forced seizure of body tissue and fluids, property, forced vaccination, testing, isolation, quarantine and arrest without due process. While not all of these draconian regulations have yet been implemented en masse, they exist in the letter of the law and therefore could be enforced, especially given that bills such as H.R.6666 use broad discretionary language leaving it to the government to intepret its meaning and apply force as it sees fit. If H.R. 6666 passes, real ""teeth"" would be put to many of the laws, acts, orders, and regulations that have been passed as executive orders over the past two months, potentially locking the entire country into an irreversible control grid the likes of which we have not seen outside of countries like China.  In light of this, H.R. 6666 may be setting the stage for the implementation of what WHO director Dr. Mike Ryan of the WHO and Ventura County California officials, say will include forcibly removing family members found positive or suspected of being infected. The only way to prevent this is to make sure the bill is opposed and dies.  Eligible recipients of funds include “faith-based” and “school-based” institutions, implying that these organizations might also become, in part, testing or treatment centers.  What is Contract Tracing?  Take a few minutes to watch the important reports by independent journalists Spyro Skouras and James Corbett on the contact tracing agenda in the rapidly unfolding story of coronavirus.  Contract tracing, which on the surface appears to mitigate the risk of disease spread by identifying carriers and interfering their further contact with the healthy, is based on a series of flawed assumptions:  The disease known as COVID-19 and believed to be caused by a singular infectious disease entity, i.e. the viral particle known as SARS-CoV-2, has never been validated through Koch postulates to be inducible and solely caused by SARS-CoV-2 within a controlled clinical or experimental setting. Over 100 different types of coronavirus have already been identified in circulation naturally around the world, and there is serious doubt that we can adequately distinguish between natural extracellular vesicles such as human exosomes and novel or endogenous forms of coronovirus already present in the human virome with the tests being used today, namely, RT-PCR. Learn more about this at www.questioningcovid.com That so-called “positive cases” identified through any number of over 100 different PCR-based and antibody-testing methods are accurate indicators of the presence of COVID-19, or do not generate false positives. If false positives are not accounted for, contract tracing can cause or contribute to a falsely expanding epidemic and those who are unnecessarily quarantined and treated will succumb to greatly elevated iatrogenically induced morbidity and mortality risks, which will never be discovered because the so-called “confirmed case fatality rates for COVID-19” require no viral testing, and only “suspicion of infection.” This is because the WHO and US Vital Statistics agencies explicitly advise against confirming these suspicion-based deaths through viral testing and other clinical means, in an egregious departure from both science and evidence-based medicine.  If contact tracing is fraught with technical inadequacies, why would it be so aggressively implemented nationwide? One reason is that it provides a justification for total spectrum dominance via real-time surveillance and control of the entire population under the auspices of “public health safety,” into perpetuity. In essence, it is like a new “war on terror,” but with the enemy being defined as our own bodies, or contact between bodies, and the solution the complete removal of any privacy, nor right to exempt oneself or children from medical mandates. The system would likely include tracking GPS data of mobile device users and then following back their contacts to identify, test, isolate, quarantine, medicate, or otherwise vaccinate them when one becomes available most likely in the fall of 2020. The media has already fomented profound fear through misreporting, misrepresenting, and catastrophizing case fatality projections, over the past few months. Their egregious disregard for the truth has lead to socioenomic and psychobiological impacts that are arguably orders of magnitude more harmful and deadly than this, or any other virus believed to contribute to flu-like illness. Clearly, the media and power that be could re-manufacture another crisis, or “second” or “third” wave simply be repeating what they have already one (learn more on the topic via the Corbett Report). At which point, with an army of contact tracers, testers, quarantine enforcers, and medicators and vaccinators, the systems being funded by H.R. 6666 would be ready to further this agenda.  So, why does H.R. 6666 refrain from providing even the most rudimentary details to how one of the largest and most widespread in impact bills ever introduced will impact those affected? The more vague and broad the language, the less oversight. The truth is that the detailed plans for how H.R.666 will be implemented were already written and revealed to the public a month ago by the Rockefeller Foundation in a 30-page plan titled, “NATIONAL COVID-19 TESTING ACTION PLAN:Pragmatic steps to reopen our workplaces and our communities.” Not coincidentally, the plan proposed the exact same dollar figure was required - 100 billion dollars -- and suggested that between 100-300,000 contract tracers would be needed.

"The overall effort, first reported by the media platform Devex, is described as the President’s Response to Outbreaks, or PRO.  Under the proposed initiative, the State Department would appoint a coordinator to oversee nearly every aspect of pandemic preparedness and response — from the global distribution of vaccines and therapeutics to the development of modernized protocols to prevent the spread of an outbreak.  “Having a singular initiative to focus global attention and resources has been an effective model to turn the tide of diseases like HIV/AIDS and malaria,” reads an outline of the new model that U.S. officials planned to circulate on Capitol Hill. “Through PRO the U.S. will assert global leadership for mobilizing private and public partners, multilateral institutions and other bilateral donors to support a global pandemic response that will deliver results for the American people.”  The proposal comes as senior administration officials grapple with ongoing flaws in the federal government’s response to Covid-19, which has pitted top agencies against each other as they work to secure medical supplies for U.S. stockpiles and other nations, and has often resulted in conflicting guidance from the White House and public health officials.  The plan could decrease USAID’s role by consolidating pandemic preparedness under the State Department, which lacks the volume of supply chain experts, epidemiologists and public health experts on staff at USAID. There also are questions about whether the initiative will focus strictly on infectious disease outbreaks or be expanded to include other types of global health issues.  One USAID official familiar with the proposal described it as a “power-grab” by the State Department. Another called it a “turf fight.”  The State Department declined to comment on “purportedly leaked deliberative documents.” A spokesperson for USAID declined to comment.  Some at USAID questioned whether now is an appropriate time to overhaul the existing response model given the ongoing coronavirus crisis. The number of pandemic-related deaths in the United States is nearing 100,000, and the Trump administration is shifting its focus to a swift reopening of the U.S. economy.  But, according to one USAID official, State Department leaders have been frustrated with USAID’s response to the novel coronavirus, feeling it’s been slow and not always aligned with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s priorities.  Members of the White House coronavirus task force, led by Vice President Mike Pence, also previously complained about USAID’s distribution of medical supplies to other countries at the height of the Covid-19 crisis, when U.S. hospitals and front-line workers faced shortages of personal protective equipment.  USAID is technically an independent agency, but it is supposed to take policy guidance from the secretary of State, whose department plays a role in USAID’s budget management.  “My read of it is they’re unhappy with USAID,” the USAID official said, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the topic. “USAID hasn’t been able to deliver on certain things.”  Documents circulated inside the administration were short on details about which programs at USAID could be relocated under the two components of PRO: America’s Response to Outbreaks, and the Preparedness Initiative for Pandemics and Emergency Response. It will differ from programs such as the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and the President’s Malaria Initiative, but will incorporate lessons from them, according to an FAQ.  Aside from working on the coronavirus response, Birx — who could not immediately be reached for comment — holds titles including U.S. special representative for global health diplomacy. She’s been based at the State Department, and her duties include dealing with global HIV/AIDS programs, including PEPFAR.  “The goal at this stage is to develop a unified whole-of-government response and approach to pandemics that will allow us to bring together all of our government’s tools to meet the challenges we will face in this new era of pandemics,” one of the documents reads. “As the discussions progress towards implementation, we will clearly define specific roles and responsibilities across agencies, consistent with their mandates.”  According to the proposal, the ARO coordinator would work with government agencies and the private sector “to ensure the full power and expertise of the United States are leveraged to … prevent, detect, and respond to infectious diseases and mitigate and prepare for future disease outbreaks.”",1

(CD) – America’s billionaires saw their combined net worth soar by $434 billion between March 18 and May 19 while the coronavirus pandemic killed tens of thousands of people and ravaged the U.S. economy, forcing more than 30 million out of work.  That’s according to a new analysis released Thursday by Americans for Tax Fairness (ATF) and the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS) titled “Tale of Two Crises: Billionaires Gain as Workers Feel Pandemic Pain.”  “The pandemic has revealed the deadly consequences of America’s yawning wealth gap, and billionaires are the glaring symbol of that economic inequality.” —Frank Clemente, Americans for Tax Fairness  The report shows that the five wealthiest billionaires in the U.S.—Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Bill Gates of Microsoft, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway, and Larry Ellison of Oracle—saw their collective wealth grow by a total of $75.5 billion between March 18 and May 19, a 19% jump.  ATF and IPS pinpoint March 18 as “the rough start date of the pandemic shutdown, when most federal and state economic restrictions were in place.”  Bezos—the world’s richest man—saw his wealth jump by nearly $35 billion in the two-month period. Yet even as Bezos’ fortune continues to grow, Amazon announced last week that it will not extend $2-an-hour hazard pay for warehouse workers beyond the end of May.  “The pandemic has revealed the deadly consequences of America’s yawning wealth gap, and billionaires are the glaring symbol of that economic inequality,” Frank Clemente, ATF’s executive director, said in a statement.  ⏰It’s that time again:⏰ Our weekly @inequalityorg update on how much U.S. billionaires are profiting off the same pandemic that’s forcing millions out of work.

"Caitlin Johnston is an independent journalist based in Melbourne, Australia. Her website is here and you can follow her on Twitter @caitoz  Anti-Beijing sentiment is being deliberately whipped up by an imperialist America, its supine allies and supportive media oligarchs. But it’s just self-serving propaganda that needs to be called out.  China is in the news every day now. Today here in Australia, we’re pretending to be offended because a Chinese tabloid published the accusation that our nation is a “giant kangaroo that serves as a dog of the US,” even though we all know that’s completely true and we should be flattered that at least they said “giant.”  Before that, we were getting indignant over a hefty barley tariff in response to our facilitation of America’s global anti-China spin campaign, which it turns out Washington screwed us on.  Also on rt.com ‘GIANT KANGAROO’ acting as ‘dog of the US’: Chinese newspaper mocks Australia amid trade row  Anti-China sentiment has been thriving in Australia, aided by our Murdoch-dominated news media, State Department-funded think tanks explicitly geared toward manipulating the China narrative, and of course our own deep-seated racism and xenophobia.  Because of its geographical location, the US military/intelligence asset conventionally known as Australia has been a major focal point for the US-centralized empire’s propaganda campaign against the most powerful unabsorbed nation in the world.  China is in the news constantly now, and it’s not because of any virus. It’s not because of Hong Kong, it’s not because of Uighurs, it’s not because of intellectual property violations or any of the other scattershot, unrelated hodgepodge of excuses you’re being fed as to why the Chinese government must be regarded as the latest Actual Hitler all of a sudden.  China is in the news all the time because of imperialism.  To understand what’s going on with China and why the “news” media keep punching you in the face with stories about how awful it is, you really only need to grasp two basic points:  Point 1: We are in the middle of a slow-motion third world war between the US-centralized power alliance and the nations which have resisted being absorbed into it.  A loose alliance of nationless oligarchs who use governments as weapons have secured control over a large empire-like cluster of nations with economic and military might loosely centralized around the United States. In order to gain more power and ensure its ongoing hegemony, this oligarchic empire must keep expanding by absorbing more nations and brutalizing them if they resist. China is by far the most powerful of the unabsorbed nations, followed by Russia at a distant second and Iran at a distant third.  Read more  Nuclear weapons make another hot world war undesirable, so this one takes the form of resource control, economic warfare, staging coups, arming oppositional militias to use as proxy armies, expanding military presence in key geostrategic regions under the pretense of fighting terrorism, and “humanitarian interventionism,” with old-school full-scale ground invasions used only as a last resort, and only after manufacturing sufficient international approval to ensure the continued cohesion of the empire-like power alliance.  But the end goal is the same as that of a conventional world war: to beat the other side into submission and compliance. And, in this case, absorption into the imperial blob. After the fall of the Soviet Union, the prevailing orthodoxy in US power structures became that the US must maintain unipolar hegemony at all cost to maintain a “liberal world order” (even if it means abandoning “liberal” values whenever it’s convenient). From that point on, the agenda has been global domination and the slow, suffocating subversion of anyone who gets in the way.  Point 2: Propaganda is used to move this world war along.  In a conventional war, each side has clear military objectives that everyone understands, and the weapons are naturally moved around in accordance with these objectives. In this weird slow-motion world war, nobody understands what’s going on besides the major power players and those who are paying very close attention.  The various agendas against the governments of Iran, Venezuela, Russia, Syria, China, etc. appear different and unrelated when looked at individually, and indeed you will see different political factions supporting some of these agendas but not others. The only thing unifying this slow-motion movement toward the destruction and absorption of all unabsorbed nations is carefully constructed propaganda narratives.  The way these unifying propaganda narratives operate is simple. It would never occur to rank-and-file citizens that a nation on the other side of the planet that’s pretty much just doing its own thing needs to be sanctioned, subverted and brought to heel, so the imperialist oligarchs who own the political/media class make sure everyone is fed custom-made narratives according to their own ideological echo chamber to prevent any domestic inertia from being thrown on these agendas.  Also on rt.com Is the US abandoning its war on Iran to focus directly on the so-called China threat?  Once there’s sufficient agreement that Saddam/Gaddafi/Morales/Assad/Maduro/whomever must go, the campaign to subvert, sabotage and absorb that government can safely be escalated.  If you can understand points one and two, you can understand everything that’s happening with China, and everything that will continue to happen. Propaganda narratives will be rolled out with increasing aggression which have the long-term goal of alienating China from its allies, hurting its economic interests, and preventing its rise to true superpower status and creating a multipolar world.  And the funny thing is, none of this is necessary. Westerners have been deliberately propagandized into believing that China wants to take over the world and will do so unless kept in line by the United States, which has surrounded China with military bases in an act of extreme aggression that the US itself would never tolerate from any unabsorbed government. But if you really grill people on how they know that China wants to take over the world, you’ll find they don’t have any substantial evidence for it.  They’ll tell you that China has an authoritarian government which persecutes ethnic and religious minorities, wrongly claiming that this means they want to take over the world and inflict the same on everyone else. They’ll tell you China has sought to expand control over some directly adjacent territories, wrongly claiming that this means they want to dominate the planet militarily like the US currently does.  They’ll cite evidence which shows China is seeking to become a superpower and create a multipolar world (something China openly admits) and wrongly claim that this is proof that they are seeking to dominate the world with unipolar hegemony.  They won’t be able to produce any actual, hard evidence that China is trying to take over the world and censor your internet and take away your rights, because no such evidence exists. It’s a completely empty belief arising from aggressive narrative manipulation.  “One myth I think really that needs to be dispelled is that somehow China is aiming to replace America and going to run the world, and it’s not,” said Chinese venture capitalist and social scientist Eric Li on the John Pilger documentary The Coming War on China. “First of all, the Chinese are not that stupid. The West, with its Christian roots, are about converting other people into their beliefs. The Chinese are not about that. It’s just that — again, I’m not degrading the Western culture, I’m just pointing out the inherent nature, the DNA of two different cultures — the Chinese two thousand years ago built the Great Wall to keep the barbarians out, not to invade them.”  I’d say this is a reasonable summary. After European nations tried to conquer the planet just a few generations ago in the name of spreading Christianity and “civilization,” we’re projecting our sick vestigial colonialist values on a nation whose culture never drove it to such madness.

Unabsorbed nations should be allowed to remain unabsorbed, absorbed nations should have their sovereignty restored (or in Australia’s case, granted to it for the first time since its existence as a nation), and America should begin acting like a normal country.  The notion of “pre-crime” is the purview of dystopian horror fiction when applied to individual people, and there’s no reason we should find the prospect of attacking and destroying for hypothetical future offenses any less insane on an international scale.  There was never any reason for the coronavirus to be made into an issue of international conflict when it could just as easily be an issue of international collaboration, and indeed collaborating is what we should all be doing, with this virus and with everything else. Let’s end this weird slow-motion world war and move toward sanity.  Like this story? Share it with a friend!",0
"(Natural News) WithÂ experts still scrambling to develop a viable cure for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), different so-called solutions to beat the disease have started cropping up.  FromÂ vinegar to radiation, professionals have toutedÂ a host of products and practices alleged to be effective against COVID-19.  With each passing week, there seems to be a new and improved instant âfixâ to the disease. That said, most of theseÂ fixes are proven to be ineffective and based on no scientific evidence whatsoever.  How to prepare for COVID-19  With the pandemic still ongoing, COVID-19 remains an active area of research. Scientists are moving at a snail’s pace when it comes to understanding the new coronavirus, but it cannot be helped.  What can be helped, though, is our bodies. As with most infections and diseases, a person is more susceptible to pathogens if he or she isn’t fit to begin with. While it’s true that the virus can still latch onto the healthiest individuals, watching out for certain biomarkers of poor health can afford us time to turn things around before it’s too late.  With that, here are some helpful tips toÂ follow in preparation for COVID-19:  Watch out for signs of diabetes  According to recent reports from the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), older people and people with pre-existing medical conditions like diabetes and heart disease are more vulnerable to severe complications linked to COVID-19.  One reason for this is that infections tend to be harder to cure in general for people with diabetes due to fluctuations in blood glucose levels and the presence of diabetes complications. People with chronic diseases like diabetes also tend to be immunocompromised, thus making them more susceptible to COVID-19.  If you haven’t been diagnosed with prediabetes or diabetes, some signs to watch out for include increased thirst, frequent urination, sudden weight loss, blurred vision, slow-healing wounds, tender gums and frequent infections.  Avoid foods that raise cholesterol and blood pressure  Heart health depends on two major factors: cholesterol and blood pressure. Excess cholesterol can lead to clogged arteries, increasing the risk of heart attack, stroke and heart failure. High blood pressure, on the other hand, often leads to arterial stiffness, another major factor for heart disease.  Like diabetes, heart disease makes a person more susceptible to severe complications related to COVID-19. People with heart disease tend to be weaker in general due to poor blood circulation. To support heart health, avoid the following foods:Â pastries, processed meat, red meat and canned foods.  Quit smoking  The Wuhan coronavirus targets the lungs, so quitting or refraining from smoking should be a no-brainer. A recent review published inÂ Tobacco Induced DiseasesÂ established that smoking is associated with theÂ negative progression and adverse outcomesÂ of COVID-19.  In particular, smoking can exacerbate complications linked to pneumonia and the flu, two infectious diseases with symptoms similar to those of COVID-19. These complications include wheezing, shortness of breath, chronic coughs, chest pain and fever.  Exercise often  There is no conclusive evidence that being fit reduces the risk of contracting COVID-19, but recent studies show that exercise helps strengthen the immune system.  Exercise, in particular, can help flush out bacteria and other pathogens from the lungs, thus reducing the risk of catching a cold, flu and other similar infections.  Exercise also stimulates antibodies and white blood cells to work harder, resulting in the better detection of harmful pathogens. The rise in temperature after a period of exercise can also inhibit bacterial growth in the lungs.  In addition, exercise helps reduce cholesterol and regulate blood pressure.  Lose weight  Overweight individuals are at an increased risk of chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease. As discussed earlier, conditions like these can compromise an individual’s immune functions and make them more susceptible to COVID-19.  As such, it’s important to follow a balanced diet. Diabetic or obese individuals can take it a step further and follow a plant-based diet.Â This diet can include animal products, but a large chunk of it should be comprised of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, fish and olive oil.  Coupling a balanced diet with regular exercise can also help burn excess weight and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.  Maintaining a healthy body and a strong immune system greatly reduces your risk of catching COVID-19.Â (Related: Strengthen the immune system with these 12 superfoods.)

"Ron Paul recently warned “rushed-into-production” vaccines for other viruses have had disastrous health consequences for some people…  President Trump’s “Operation Warp Speed,” a public-private partnership to develop a vaccine and ready it for mass production by early 2021, has generated anti-vaccine concerns among some Americans, a new survey finds.  The survey, published via Reuters/Ipsos on Thursday, found 25% of Americans have no interest in taking a coronavirus vaccine.  About 36% of respondents said they would be less willing to take a vaccine if President Trump said it was safe. Only 14% said they would be interested.  Reuters/Ipsos surveyed 4,428 Americans between May 13-19 said they would need to review additional research on the vaccine to determine if it was safe.  A little less than 66% were “very” or “somewhat” interested in a vaccine if made readily available.  Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, told Reuters, considering there are 92,000 virus-related deaths, he thought there would be a much higher amount of people that would want the vaccine.  “It’s a little lower than I thought it would be with all the attention to COVID-19,” said Schaffner. “I would have expected somewhere around 75 percent.”  The survey found 14% were not interested at all, 10% were not very interested, and 11% were unsure about subjecting themselves to a vaccine.  Health experts tell Reuters that, “at least 70% of Americans would need to be immune through a vaccine or prior infection to achieve what is known as “herd immunity,” when enough people are resistant to an infectious disease to prevent its spread.”  President Trump’s Operation Warp Speed program aims to produce 300 million doses of a vaccine by January, a goal that we’ve said is widely unrealistic.  The president’s constant hype of vaccines has led some people to believe many of the drugs in development are being rushed and could have dangerous side effects. Ron Paul recently warned “rushed-into-production” vaccines for other viruses have had disastrous health consequences for some people.  Nearly 84% of respondents said vaccines for measles are safe, suggesting that people are doubtful about a rushed vaccine for COVID-19. Of the folks who were “not very” interested in taking the vaccine, 29% of them said they would reassess their thoughts once the FDA approved it.  Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, where his staff is currently developing a vaccine, said:  “It’s not surprising a significant percentage of Americans are not going to take the vaccine because of the terrible messaging we’ve had, the absence of a communication plan around the vaccine and this very aggressive anti-vaccine movement.”  The poll underlines how political divides among Democrats and Republicans predate the pandemic, but lockdowns have since catalyzed new divides and exacerbating old ones. That being, nearly 20% of Republicans said they had no interest in a vaccine, which was more than double the proportion of Democrats who said the same.  With creepy billionaire Bill Gates and big government rushing vaccines into development and for possible mass production next year — the anti-vaccine movement in America continues to grow.  https://www.zerohedge.com/health/quarter-americans-have-no-interest-taking-covid-vaccine  Liked it?

"President Donald Trump’s response to the Coronavirus pandemic has been an abject failure by any reasonable measurement. The U.S. is fast approaching a full 100,000 Coronavirus deaths, but this weekend, Trump went golfing at a course in northern Virginia that’s a part of his own company. During a recent appearance on MSNBC, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) delivered a memorable takedown of the efforts from the president and his allies to distract Americans from the actual devastation at hand. Ahead of the November election, Trump seems desperate to rush into any kind of rhetoric except the reality of the situation.  Facts First: CNN's Daniel Dale digs into President Trump’s false claims about a hydroxychloroquine study, mail-in voting and saying he was named Michigan’s “Man of the Year” https://t.co/SCWu25vqbI pic.twitter.com/MH5Z0YlRoL — CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) May 23, 2020  As Schiff summarized on Twitter:  ‘Over 90,000 Americans have died from COVID-19. Our economy is in a downward spiral to Great Depression-levels. Trump doesn’t want the public to focus on his tragic failures. So, to paraphrase Steve Bannon, in order to distract: His people are flooding the zone with excrement.’  Over 90,000 Americans have died from COVID-19. Our economy is in a downward spiral to Great Depression-levels. Trump doesn't want the public to focus on his tragic failures. So, to paraphrase Steve Bannon, in order to distract: His people are flooding the zone with excrement. pic.twitter.com/WxUJzt9hZd — Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) May 23, 2020  The conspiracy theories from the president and his allies have been numerous at this point. Towards the beginning of the crisis, the president even claimed that concern about the virus was a “hoax” and suggested that coverage of the then-growing crisis was some kind of plot to make him look bad. That obviously was not true. More recently, the president’s team’s conspiracy theories have included the idea that the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine is some kind of untapped goldmine for Coronavirus treatment, but a new study reveals that among tens of thousands of Coronavirus cases, usage of the drug was linked with a higher death rate across the board.  Hydroxychloroquine, the antimalarial drug touted by President Trump, is linked to increased risk of death in coronavirus patients, according to analysis of 96,000 patients published in the Lancet. Hydroxychloroquine is unproven for fighting coronavirus. https://t.co/LpHS9CuEmL — MSNBC (@MSNBC) May 23, 2020  Most recently, Trump staged a spectacle at a White House press conference on Friday when he claimed that governors must allow churches and other houses of worship to reopen this weekend or else he would “override” them and reopen the churches himself. Trump has no authority to “override” governors, and besides, religious and political authorities around the country have already been collaborating on the development of safe reopening plans for houses of worship. Trump’s spectacle was for show.  Breaking News: If the U.S. had begun imposing social distancing measures one week earlier than it did in March, about 36,000 fewer people would have died in the coronavirus outbreak, according to new estimates from Columbia University researchers https://t.co/phnyEgZice — The New York Times (@nytimes) May 21, 2020  Check out Twitter’s response to Schiff below:",0

"Thousands of cars and motorbikes honking horns and waving Spanish flags drove in procession through Madrid on Saturday, May 23, as part of a nationwide protest called by the far-right Vox party against the country's coronavirus lockdown.  Spain, which imposed one of Europe's toughest lockdowns on March 14, has started to ease restrictions, but Madrid and Barcelona have remained in lockdown for longer because of more severe coronavirus outbreaks.  The protesters called for Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and Deputy Prime Minister Pablo Iglesias, of the centre-left Socialists and left-wing Podemos coalition, to resign over their handling of the coronavirus crisis, and, in particular, the lockdowns and the damage done to the economy and jobs.  Protests against the lockdown started in Madrid's wealthy Salamanca neighbourhood last week, where people started banging pots and pans. But Saturday's procession marked the first organised protest against the government since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic.  Vox urged people to protest in every regional capital, and similar car processions took place in Seville and Barcelona, among others.  Madrid and Barcelona are preparing to ease their lockdowns from Monday as infections have slowed. This will allow outdoor dining and gatherings of up to 10 people.  Spain has registered 28,628 deaths from COVID-19 and 234,824 cases.  (Source: Reuters)",0
"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.  The US could finally be free of the coronavirus in late September, and the whole world can expect to put the pandemic behind them in December, say scientists in Singapore.  The rosy forecasts are from the Singapore University of Technology and Design, where researchers are using artificial intelligence to continually update their charting of the pandemic’s “life cycle” by country.  At the end of April, predictions showed that the US would be virus-free by Sept. 20 and the UK could see the end of the coronavirus by Aug. 27, Metro.co.uk reported Saturday.  But the group has since taken down its country-by-country charts from its website — instead posting a disclaimer that the research was strictly for educational purposes and may contain errors.  Scientists at the university caution that their results are continually evolving and inexact– and that the predictions should not lead to hasty ends of lockdowns around the world.  “Over-optimism based on some predicted end dates is dangerous because it may loosen our disciplines and controls and cause the turnaround of the virus,” they said.",0
"Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer is famous for her tyrannical rule, her blind ambition, her audacious behavior and her ignorance.  In March crazed Democrat Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer prohibited big box retailers from in-person sale of seeds because according to her, plant seeds were non-essential.  Whitmer also called on Home Depot and Lowes to close off certain sections like flooring, garden centers and plant nurseries.  The tyrannical governor of Michigan also barred grocery stores and brick-and-mortar retailers from selling vegetable seeds because she could.  TRENDING: ""Back of the Line!"" - Karma Hits After Gretchen Whitmer's Husband Tries to Cut in Line Before Michigan Boaters After His Wife Banned Motor Boating for Weeks!  .@GovWhitmer has banned us from growing our own food. This is fucking insane. pic.twitter.com/qOGMsBBVXJ — Whatevs II (@joesichspach) April 10, 2020  In late March Michigan Democrat Governor Gretchen Whitmer limited access of doctors from prescribing the lifesaving drugs hydroxychloroquine and Z-Paks to save senior citizens in the state from Coronavirus. Then she continued to send coronavirus patients to nursing homes. This is still happening in May!  And in her latest unexplainable move the far left governor banned motorboats and jet skis but canoes and sailboats were acceptable.  This woman is a crackpot.  On Friday an employee at a dock in northern Michigan shared an interesting story about a phone call with Gretchen Whitmer’s husband.  This was just days after Whitmer finally lifted her nonsensical ban on motorboating.  Via 100% Fed Up:  Yesterday, an employee of North Shore Dock, in northern MI, a company that provides boat and dock services in northern Michigan, including the Birch Lake area, shared an interesting story about a phone call the North Shore Dock company received, allegedly from Governor Whitmer’s husband, Dr. Mark Mallory. So today put a smile on my face, as most of your know we install docks, store boats etc. This morning I was out working when the office called me, there was a gentleman on hold who wanted his boat in the water before the weekend. Being memorial weekend and the fact that we started working 3 weeks late means there is no chance this is going to happen. Well, our office personnel had explained this to the man and he replied: “I am the husband to the governor, will this make a difference?” The employee (his name has been blacked out to protect his privacy) continued: As you can imagine, that does make a difference, that would put you at the back of the line!!! Needless to say, our Governor and her husband will not be getting their boat for memorial day. He added: Too good not to share, I love it when karma comes around, even in small doses. To summarize, the Michigan’s Democrat governor has placed the entire state of Michigan under lockdown for several weeks. On the same day that she announced she would be reopening businesses in certain areas of northern Michigan, which includes the area where her vacation home is located, her husband’s vehicle is seen parked in their driveway. Two days later, when businesses that have been shut down for months are allowed to reopen, Governor Whitmer’s husband calls North Shore Dock company and asks to take cuts in front of common Michiganders, because he’s the husband of the woman who shut down their business in the first place. North Shore Dock, LLC put out a statement on Facebook a few hours ago, confirming that Governor Whitmer’s husband did call their business and ask to have his boat put in the water. According to the North Shore Dock Facebook post, he was told he would not be given preferential treatment and that he would have to wait in line like everyone else, adding, “ALL of our customers are valued, and we cannot place you in front of others who scheduled earlier.”  Incredible!

"The CEO of French telecoms firm Bouygues has called on the government to postpone auctions for 5G frequencies, citing the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and public mistrust of the technology.  France is planning on auctioning 5G frequencies to telecoms companies at the end of the summer. However, Martin Bouygues, head of the eponymous communications firm, now thinks that bidding should be pushed back to the end of the year at the earliest.  Also on rt.com DHS & FBI fear more attacks on 5G infrastructure fueled by Covid-19 conspiracies  “We need to push back the auction date simply because the economic world today is not the same as it was early March, when the terms of the auction were set,” he told Le Figaro on Saturday, adding that holding a bidding war while France recovers “with difficulty from a terrible human health and economic health nightmare” is “not the priority of the country.”  Bouygues is not an opponent of the technology. Indeed, his firm has already secured a 50 megahertz block, as have rivals Orange, Free, and SFR.  His opposition to the auction likely stems from the fact that France is currently facing an economic recession, with growth expected to drop by eight percent this year after an extended and nationwide lockdown. As such, the return on his investment simply wouldn’t be as large as it would have been pre-pandemic.  However, Bouygues also noted that the rollout of 5G technology has come in spite of growing public mistrust.  Also on rt.com Anti-5G fever spreads to the Netherlands as towers suffer ‘arson and sabotage’  Aside from claims that Chinese firms like Huawei could use 5G hardware to relay secrets to the government in Beijing – pushed by the Donald Trump administration in Washington and denied by Huawei and China – 5G has become a target for conspiracy theorists the world over. Fueled by some lingering uncertainties over the potential health consequences of 5G’s short wavelength transmissions, skeptics have claimed that 5G masts can trigger anything from cancer to Covid-19.  Some of the more radical among these conspiracy theorists directly blame these broadcasting masts for causing the coronavirus in the first place, despite the lack of evidence to support their claims. 5G towers erected in the Netherlands and UK have been set on fire by activists, with British protesters going as far as spitting on and attacking the telecoms engineers installing the masts.  The situation is the same outside Europe too. Arson attacks on 5G infrastructure have been reported in Australia and New Zealand, while the US Department of Homeland Security warned last week that online “misinformation campaigns” have “already prompted arson and physical attacks against cell towers in several US states.”  Like this story?

"When I was growing up in the US during the 1960’s, 1970’s and 1980’s, one of the prized freedoms we often and repeatedly talked about was the right to pray to God as one understands God, to be free both to go to the church of your church and to be free from going to the national church by requirement. Sure, this led to a pluralistic society, and sure, there are major challenges for each faith group in competition with other such groups and with the predominant secularism in the US, but believers have always had the freedom to pray and worship as they like.  Until now.  The coronavirus pandemic brought in a wide series of restrictions against gathering in public places all over the world. In our own series on the rightness or wrongness of Orthodox Christian places of worship closing due to government regulations, we noted that the restriction on religious worship is not particularly directed at Christians only. Mecca is closed, the Indian, Japanese and some Jewish religious activities have all shown the effects of COVID-19 prevention regimes.  However, in the United States, we now have elected leaders violating the principles set forth in the Constitution, namely, the very first Amendment:  “Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free excercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.”  Instead, we have governors ordering churches closed, people fined and even arrested for going, and in places like Mississippi, the sentiment against Christian churchgoers has turned particularly nasty. A parish was burned to the ground, acccording to The New York Times:  The burning of a church in northern Mississippi this week is being investigated as arson because of a spray-painted message at the scene that seemed to criticize the church’s defiance of coronavirus restrictions. First Pentecostal Church had sued the city of Holly Springs, Miss., which is about an hour southeast of Memphis, arguing that its stay-at-home order had violated the church’s right to free speech and interfered with its members’ ability to worship. After firefighters put out the blaze early Wednesday, the police found a message, “Bet you stay home now you hypokrits,” spray-painted on the ground near the church’s doors, according to Maj. Kelly McMillen of the Marshall County Sheriff’s Department. A photograph of the graffiti also appears to show an atomic symbol with an “A” in the center, which is sometimes used as a logo for atheist groups.  One thing this clearly proves is that bigots cannot spell correctly.  But it also proves there is a great deal of animosity against Christians. This kind of attack would not have taken place even ten years ago, but now the anti-Christian climate in the United States is such that incidents like this are looking for ways to happen.  This video shows how embedded anti-Christian attitudes are now in the press corps at the White House. Watch as Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany deftly and forcefully handles the ferocious accusations that go beyond First Amendment sensibilities.  On Friday, May 22nd, President Trump called on state governments to allow churches to open, and has also threatened to override any state that refuses to do so. Here is what he said, with emphasis added:  Thank you very much. At my direction, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is issuing guidance for communities of faith. I want to thank Dr. Redfield and the CDC for their work on this matter and all the other work they’ve been doing over the past what now seems like a long period of time. Today I’m identifying houses of worship, churches, synagogue and mosques as essential places that provide essential services. Some governors have deemed liquor stores and abortion clinics as essential, but have left out churches and other houses of worship. It’s not right. So I’m correcting this injustice and calling houses of worship essential. I call upon governors to allow our churches and places of worship to open right now. If there’s any question, they’re going to have to call me, but they’re not going to be successful in that call. These are places that hold our society together and keep our people united. The people are demanding to go to church and synagogue, go to their mosque. Many millions of Americans embrace worship as an essential part of life. The ministers, pastors, rabbis, imams and other faith leaders will make sure that their congregations are safe as they gather and pray. I know them well. They love their congregations. They love their people. They don’t want anything bad to happen to them or to anybody else. The governors need to do the right thing and allow these very important, essential places of faith to open right now for this weekend. If they don’t do it, I will override the governors. In America, we need more prayer, not less. Thank you very much. Thank you.  President Trump has this basic point right: without prayer to God, our nation is sunk. And it is, indeed, amazing how vile and anti-Christian our supposed “best and brightest” have turned out to be. Incidentally, the press and “Experts” are saying that the president has no power to make this stick. They are wrong. In the spirit of the First Amendment, he absolutely does have the power to make this order stick.  Liked it? Take a second to support The Duran on Patreon!

"Shocking developments have come to light in the case of a young black man who brutally battered an elderly military veteran at a nursing home in a video that went viral on social media.  The father of the assailant is speaking out, saying that his son suffers from serious mental illness and was quarantined in a nursing home with at-risk elderly people after testing positive for COVID-19.  Kimberly Craig of WXYZ 7 ABC broke the insane news that shows how the most vulnerable are being put at risk due to the decisions of government bureaucrats and the so-called first responders.

This highly dangerous individual was put around vulnerable people who he could brutalize as well as possibly infect with COVID-19.  The assailant’s father said that his son had been taken to a group home for supervision, but had a mental health relapse as he was hearing voices in his head. When he was taken to the University of Michigan Hospital for supervision as a result, he was diagnosed with COVID-19. That is when he was taken to the Westwood Nursing Center where he would commit his savage assault.  It is unknown whether or not the nursing home called the police to alert them about the assault that had taken place in their facilities. The assailant is currently in police custody, and it is yet to be determined if he will be charged for what he did.  The sickening video of the assault can be seen here:  i have been sending this to every news anchor i can think of … do your part and help me so we can fckin help him … godfuickindamnit this makes me mad pic.twitter.com/SuJD69IABV — 🏴‍☠️user(""/n/3/f/"").adm1n=255()🏴‍☠️ (@nulluser10) May 21, 2020  “He never should have been housed.. quarantined with the victim that he eventually assaulted. That should have never happened,” the father said. “Someone dropped the ball.”  The person who dropped the ball may have been Governor Gretchen Whitmer, who issued a directive that forced COVID-19 patients to be housed in nursing homes.  Big League Politics reported on how state Democrats are turning on Whitmer for essentially issuing death sentences to the elderly with her incomprehensible and arguably genocidal policy prescriptions:  Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer’s heavy-handed authoritarian governance has made her a pariah throughout the state, and Democrats are starting to become frustrated with her leadership as a result. State representative Leslie Love (D-Detroit) is flabbergasted over Whitmer’s order to send coronavirus patients into nursing homes, which has resulted in an untold number of unnecessary deaths by putting the most vulnerable population at needless risk. “To return seniors into an environment, seniors with the virus still recovering from the virus, into an environment with, well, seniors, just didn’t seem — it’s not a good idea,” Love said. Whitmer made an executive order in April that mandated seniors diagnosed with COVID-19 to be placed into nursing homes, called “regional hubs,” to be around other healthy seniors. State officials claim that the policy is effective because of distance requirements that are required between the healthy and unhealthy seniors. “It’s a good move, a good step to make these regional hubs, and I think as we move forward, we have to look at making sure we’re really implementing best practices, looking to other best practices across the state,” Chief Medical Executive Joneigh S. Khaldun said. Initially, the state wanted to put the sick seniors at the TCF Center in Detroit but that became untenable after the site was shut down. This meant seniors with coronavirus were put into nursing homes among the vulnerable instead. Love is worried about individuals in nursing homes throughout the state, including her 86-year-old mother, catching the highly-infectious disease. “That would break my heart because I’ve been on the front lines of this, trying to make sure our seniors — my mother, your mother, anybody else’s mother — does not get sick and die from this, particularly if they’re in a nursing home,” Love said.  Complicit government officials like Whitmer want to keep the panic going so they cannot be held accountable for their crimes against humanity in how they have responded to the pandemic.",0
"Dana White says he is planning to spend the whole of July on the UFC's fabled 'Fight Island' as the promotion switches events there during the Covid-19 fallout - but the location of the island remains a closely-guarded secret.  The UFC recently got back up and running with three events in a week in Jacksonville, Florida, and has another card planned for May 30 at its own Apex venue in Las Vegas - subject to Nevada state approval.  Beyond that, White says he is planning on finally putting his 'Fight Island' plan into action - an idea which first emerged when the coronavirus outbreak began to ravage sport in the US.

"France and Germany have announced they are backing the creation of an EU bond to raise €500 billion to boost the European economy, severely hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.  On Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel unveiled a joint plan to boost EU recovery from the coronavirus crisis after weeks of discussions on how to deploy the billions of euros needed to end the economic shock and recession.  The plan promoted by France and Germany calls for the creation of a €500 billion recovery fund able to offer grants to the worst-affected countries and regions.  IFO Institute President (Leibniz Institute for Economic Research at the University of Munich) Clemens Fuest has supported the German-French initiative to help the EU and offered his views on the matter during an online press conference with the Association of Foreign Press in Germany (VAP).  Sputnik: What do you think of Macron and Merkel’s new plan to restore the EU through the European Commission? We can already see resistance to these plans. Austria, the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden insist that the EU only issue repayable loans, not subsidies. How can you explain the changed position on the part of the federal government? The federal government also spoke out against the so-called corona bonds.  Mr Fuest: What has been agreed here doesn’t really concern corona bonds. Corona bonds were not a clear, clearly defined concept, while what has been proposed is a clear, feasible concept. I very much welcome it. I think it’s important that Germany and France have come forward with a common initiative, the two states that quite often have different positions regarding EU finances, the two states that are very important to promote issues. Of course, other countries are also important and should be involved in this matter.  If we compare this with corona bonds, the corona bonds initiative, in my view, was a domestic policy initiative of the countries that presented this plan. They publicly demanded something from other states, knowing that they would refuse. It originally was something non-working. And such a policy, in my opinion, is taking place in Europe for domestic political reasons and is not constructive at the European level.  I think that this initiative is constructive. A model has been agreed that can be implemented. The huge challenge that we are facing regarding this fund is to show that the costs that are coming up here have added value due to distribution at the European level.  This means that it’s necessary to show that if the EU spends this money, it will be more beneficial than if member states lend money and spend it themselves. They could do that too. Member states must guarantee these debts. And the EU has virtually no income of its own.  Therefore, it’s all based on member states guarantees. And it must be shown that this European fund, the money that is given out, is more useful, that this money is used on things that national expenses cannot provide.  There is considerable potential for the aforementioned European added value. For example, the added value may consist in the fact that all this will become insurance. That money will go to countries that have been hit hardest by the crisis. We have some ideas in this regard. But we still don’t know exactly how much states will be affected.  According to the IMF forecast, Germany has a negative growth of seven percent, and France has a negative growth of eight percent. In Italy, negative growth is nine percent. According to the IMF forecast, this means that these three states have been affected to a similar extent. We don’t know whether things will get to this; it’s still unclear who will get this insurance money and who will pay it.  If the whole thing is organized in such a way that those who are hardest hit, but who can insure themselves against this crisis, get something, it is creating added value. A nation-state cannot insure itself.  But it wouldn’t help if all member states were hit equally. An insurance community where everyone suffers the same doesn’t help. However, added value will appear if the crisis is asymmetrical.  In the end, solidarity is also added value. This means that there is interest on the part of all European states that no country will collapse economically or destabilize. And that could also be European value-added. But, nevertheless, it won’t be easy to try to really spend money better than national money. This will need to be well demonstrated. If it works, this is very good.  I think the initiative for this fund at the European level is so important because it is a political signal that the EU is alive, that the EU is acting in a crisis like this. That is a very important signal. A signal that the EU will still be there after the crisis is a signal to everyone. It’s vital for the EU that certain actions are being taken here and that we can count on success.  On Political Debate  I expect political debate in parliament, as well as in other European countries. They are also very important, namely regarding where the will money be used and how it be determined that added value appears. What does this mean for future debt policy in Europe?  We need to understand that Rubicon is crossed here. It is fundamental reform, extensive debt financing at the European level. This will raise the question of whether the whole thing will be a dam break, whether we’ll have a sharp rise in public debt because we have a new level at which we also incur government debt, namely the European level.  It’s a very serious question. The answer given in the German-French document is correct. It says that there will be a repayment plan for these debts. And member countries must pay for it.  There will be such a repayment plan that, I hope – that would be right – in the event of the next crisis, the state debt quota in Europe as a whole – national, regional and European – won’t be higher than before this crisis. It will be better if it is lower. All of these issues will be discussed.  Question from France: Is this initiative Merkel’s answer to Macron?  I don’t think this is Merkel’s response to Macron, because this is the response to the crisis. The German-French document says a lot about European health policy. It’s necessary to create response groups.  It would be great if we had them when the pandemic broke out. This fund is a unique thing, a unique debt mechanism. It remains to be seen whether it will remain unique. After a while, new requirements for further debts will appear.  And this will lead to contradictions. Critics both in France and in my country, of course, will say that this is a dam break. Today they borrow, and tomorrow someone will want to borrow again. I think this is one of the risks you are taking.  I personally think that having weighed everything, it’s right to take risks.  Question from France: Is this the best initiative?  You can put down lots of possibilities on a blank piece of paper. I think this is a very good initiative. But many questions remain open. The package’s effectiveness will depend on how long it lasts. We must remember that EU decisions need to be ratified.  This begs the question: should it be ratified? Could it be that we will have a long-term ratification process, and these funds will come when the crisis has long ended? One can only hope that everyone understands this; there is an urgency for everyone involved.  But these are all open questions. This concept should be specified.  The EU needs to show signs of life. The fund should be created and it should become successful because it’s very difficult to imagine that the EU won’t do anything in this crisis. Critics will need to be convinced by showing that added value is created for everyone.  Question from Ukraine: is €500 billion a lot?  €500 billion amounts to about three percent of the EU’s GDP, maybe a little more. This is the amount paid over several years. This means that this is not a giant fiscal package, but it is a lot of money, first of all, compared to the current EU budget, which is a little more than one percent of GDP per year. For three years, this would be a doubling of costs.  The money should go to European programmes and it will be spent as part of the EU budget. Compared to what we are doing in Europe today, what is the EU budget, this is a lot of money.  Compared to national budgets, this, of course, is not that much. But the concept that money needs to be spent correctly is more important than the amount. In the German-French initiative, I understand it this way: here we are talking about spending within the EU budget, not about loans to someone there.

"Interest in the metal has been growing recently in light of the pandemic as one of the safest and most resilient assets for investors. Russia, however, started to build up its reserves long before the crisis emerged.  Russia has become a saviour of the global gold markets as the pandemic has spurred abnormally high demand for the precious metal while it has at the same time also crippled companies' ability to produce gold in the amounts requested by market players, the vice president of Russian gold industry giant Zolotoy Monetnyy Dom, Alexey Vyazovsky, says.  ""When a pandemic or war emerges, gold is everyone's first choice to buy. But right now buying gold is problematic. Refineries where gold alloys are purified, mints where gold coins are minted, some banks and exchanges, all infrastructure, including even some mines are closed due to quarantine"", Vyazovsky says.  The gold expert explains that Russia mines some 300 tonnes of gold each year and has huge amounts of gold stashed in reserves - something that is now saving the market. Vyazovsky stresses that the Russian government has allowed companies to export gold, with the main flows of the precious metal now going to the two main European gold hubs - London and Switzerland - which were experiencing acute shortages of physical gold.  This situation turned out to be highly profitable for Russian gold companies, the expert notes.  ""Gold prices are on the rise in Russia as it's traded in rubles. So now the gold-mining companies are getting incredible profits"", Vyazovsky says.  Russia has indeed been boosting its gold reserves for some time and started doing so long before the coronavirus pandemic hit the world. When Moscow started dumping its holdings of US Treasury bonds, it also started buying the precious metal, supposedly as a replacement for its dollar-nominated assets. In 2019, Russia became the biggest gold buyer in the world, closely followed by China.  The views and opinions expressed in the article do not necessarily reflect those of Sputnik.",0
"This Brutal Event Is Even Worse Than We Thought!  Numerous disturbing videos circulated social media on Thursday showing a black Michigan man beating an elderly white man and an elderly white woman in a nursing home.  Jaydon Hayden, reportedly from Westland, Michigan filmed himself beating elderly white nursing home patients for sport.  There were three videos on Bitchute showing the man beating white elderly men and women.  The man filmed himself beating the seniors in their beds until they were bleeding.  Absolutely shocking footage has emerged from a black male nurse from Detroit (Jadon H.), who filmed himself beating elderly white men into a bloody pulp. “Get the fuck off my bed, N.,” he is heard saying. Viewer discretion advised. pic.twitter.com/NPtCFA8YIs — Mathijs Koenraadt (@mknrdt) May 21, 2020  Judicial Watch boss Tom Fitton said the watchdog group contacted authorities after he was alerted to the disturbing videos.  “This was also posted on my Twitter feed and Judicial Watch contacted authorities who then, in response to our concern, arrested this person. Thanks to those who helped us get this done.” Tom Fitton said.  This was also posted on my @Twitter feed and @JudicialWatch contacted authorities who then, in response to our concern, arrested this person. Thanks to those who helped us get this done. https://t.co/zER9GCWVK4 — Tom Fitton (@TomFitton) May 21, 2020  Tom Fitton said according to his sources, the man was arrested.  On Friday FOX 2 Detroit in Michigan spoke with the father of the Jaydon Hayden after his arrest.  The father said his son is not vicious, but that he just has mental health issues.  And the father then said this, “He said his son called 911 and was taken to a mental health facility in Ann Arbor. Last Wednesday, he was diagnosed with COVID-19 and said he was supposed to be taken to another facility to be quarantined.  The father added, “It should’ve never happened because he should’ve never been put in that environment.”  Did you get that?  Authorities — following the orders of Governor Gretchen Whitmer — moved the young man to a nursing home to recover from COVID-19.  They moved 20-year-old Jaydon Hayden to the nursing home just last week.  According to his father, Jaydon Hayden was moved to the nursing home because he had COVID-19.  This tells us that Governor Whitmer is STILL sending COVID-19 patients to NURSING HOMES.  So not only was Jayden BEATING nursing home patients but he was spreading the coronavirus in the same nursing home.  The Attorney for the Westwood Nursing Center says they were not aware of the beating until they saw the video?  The attorney added that Jayden was not a long-term resident.  Well, that’s good!  And there’s more…  According to WXYZ.com the 75-year-old victim is a US veteran.  And according to WXYZ Jaydon was moved the hospital last Wednesday. The assault on the elderly man took place LAST FRIDAY!  And police did not arrest Jaydon until yesterday — a week later — at that same nursing home!  Jaydon Hayden beat the hell out of the seniors and was still in the facility a week later!

"Spain took a major step towards the return of normality on Saturday, as Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez announced that the country will reopen to international tourism from July.  Spain was among the nations worst affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, racking up more than 28,000 deaths from the disease. However, it’s now emerging from one of Europe’s most stringent lockdowns, which was implemented on March 14.  Prime Minister Sanchez said on Saturday that the country will reopen its doors to overseas tourists from July. International tourism is a major contributor to the Spanish economy, with around 80 million foreigners visiting every year.  And the good news didn’t end there, as Sanchez also gave the La Liga football season the green light to resume from June 8. All organised football was suspended in Spain on March 12, but clubs from the top two divisions have since returned to group training.

"A reported move to scale back a deal with Huawei has been interpreted in part as an attempt by the UK government to boost trade talks with the administration of US President Donald Trump ahead of Boris Johnson's scheduled visit to Washington for the G7 summit in June.  UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is planning to reduce the involvement of Chinese telecommunication company Huawei in the country’s 5G network rollout, according to the Daily Telegraph.  The move comes alongside plans by the United Kingdom to end its reliance on the eastern Asian country for strategic imports, including medical supplies, amid the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.  “He [Johnson] still wants a relationship with China but the Huawei deal is going to be significantly scaled back. Officials have been instructed to come up with a plan to reduce Huawei’s involvement as quickly as possible,” a source said, cited by the newspaper.  Johnson is reportedly intending to scale down China’s involvement in UK infrastructure to zero by 2023, according to the newspaper.  Downing Street has declined to comment on the report, according to Reuters. Huawei has not replied to a comment request by the outlet.  The report comes ahead of the prime minister’s scheduled June visit to the US for the G7 summit, according to the Telegraph.  Cutting Huawei’s involvement in the UK's 5G rollout is also considered a step toward boosting post-Brexit trade talks with the Trump administration, which has consistently accused Beijing of being responsible for the coronavirus pandemic.  On Friday, The Times reported that Johnson had ordered Downing Street officials to prepare a plan to put an end to the country’s reliance on China for key goods. Two working groups, headed by Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, have been formed to carry out this job.  The aim of the effort, codenamed ""Project Defend"", is said to pinpoint Britain’s main economic weaknesses and adopt measures that prevent attempts by “potentially hostile” foreign nation's to use those apparent weaknesses to their own advantage.  London has defied significant pressure from Washington after previously announcing that the UK would, with conditions, allow Chinese telecom giant Huawei to assist in the implementation of a 5G network in the nation.  The UK government said that the Chinese company, which has been accused by the US of providing back-door access to Chinese intelligence services, would be excluded from certain “safety-related” and “safety-critical” networks.  Washington has repeatedly warned London that permitting Huawei to take part in developing the country’s 5G network would put the US-UK intelligence-sharing agreements at risk.  In May 2019, the Trump administration blacklisted Huawei over allegations that the company's hardware and software connections sent data to Chinese intelligence agencies, amid trade tensions between the two economic powers that began in January 2018.  Beijing has repeatedly denied the accusations.  The US has also urged other countries to refrain from using Huawei equipment when adopting 5G network technology, as part of its pressure campaign on the Chinese tech corporation.",0
"After insisting for months that lockdowns were necessary to fight the coronavirus, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases chief Dr. Anthony Fauci now says that “prolonged shutdowns” will damage America if it’s not reopened soon.  Fauci, the institutional face of the coronavirus response and head of the White House coronavirus Task Force, suddenly changed his tune this week about reopening the country despite advocating for shutdowns just days earlier.  “I don’t want people to think that any of us feel that staying locked down for a prolonged period of time is the way to go,” Fauci said Friday on CNBC.  “Now is the time, depending upon where you are and what your situation is — is to begin to seriously [look] at reopening the economy, reopening the country to try and get back to some degree of normal. I’m totally in favor of that, if done in the proper way, in the appropriate setting.”  “In general, I think most of the country is doing it in a prudent way. There are obviously some situations where people might be jumping over that. I just say please proceed with caution if you’re going to do that,” Fauci added.  Fauci’s sudden change of heart regarding the lock downs caught the attention of Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy, who criticized Fauci during “Tucker Carlson” tonight.  “I don’t mean to pile on Fauci, but we are making very important decisions based on what he’s saying,” Portnoy told host Tucker Carlson on Friday, “and I think it’s OK to say ‘I really don’t know, guys.'”  “But I get the feeling if you asked him this question, or ‘What does one plus one equal?’ you’re going to get seven different answers.”  “I think at this point, you let people — individuals — make decisions for themselves,” he added. “The only thing, as I said before, that we absolutely know for certain is if you continue the quarantine, tons of people are going to lose their livelihoods.”  Fauci, Big Pharma and the Mainstream Media would have you believe that vaccine injuries are RARE, but when the reports start piling up of all the damage caused by the exact vaccines Fauci has touted, it’s important to start asking how rare they actually are…  Get what you and your family need with today’s top-selling products now!",0
"New Delhi (Sputnik): Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier announced a $266 billion stimulus package to revive the economy, which is bearing the brunt of the pandemic. The nation's banking regulator has indicated that growth in the current financial year (April 2020 - March 2021) will remain in the negative.  Despite facing a revenue crunch itself due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Indian Finance Ministry has said that there is no proposal to impose a calamity cess to higher revenues in the fight against the pandemic.  Sources in the ministry said that given the economic scenario amid the pandemic, an additional cess will be an ""adversity"" in itself.  A source in the Ministry of Finance said that a proposal like this would prove to be counter-productive, as with the varying degrees of lockdown across the country, sales are already at low volume. Indian PM Narendra Modi imposed the lockdown on 25 March. The national lockdown will continue until 31 May, with some relaxation to industrial, construction, and other service sectors.  ""Industry is already facing a deep crisis for want of demand and likely labour challenges that might come in near future due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, tinkering with the taxes or cess would not be a prudent option at all"", the source added.  The Indian government has taken a massive hit to its revenues because of the COVID-19 pandemic, so much so that it has not released the monthly collections of Goods and Services Tax (GST) for the month of April. In March, the Indian government brought in revenue worth $13 billion.  A Finance Ministry official told Sputnik, ""There has been a very bad impact on GST revenue for the month of April"". The official said that April GST revenue is down by at least 66 percent compared with March.  Due to the impact of the pandemic the ministry is staring at a revenue gap on both direct as well indirect tax collection for the current financial year. The net tax target of $218.12 billion planned in the budget on 1 Feb is difficult to achieve now, contends the ministry official.  However, to compensate for losses on account of the pandemic-led slowdown, the Indian government has recently enhanced this year's borrowing from the budgeted $104 million to $160 million.",0
"Iran has condemned any act of interference in the internal affairs of China and moves to undermine its national sovereignty and territorial integrity, stressing that the Islamic Republic respects the principle of a united China.  “Non-interference in the affairs of other countries, maintenance of territorial integrity and showing respect for the national sovereignty of other countries are among clear and unchangeable principles of the Islamic Republic of Iran’s foreign policy,” Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Abbas Mousavi said on Sunday.  “Therefore, while emphasizing the importance of respect for the principle of the ‘united China’, the Islamic Republic of Iran condemns any foreign interference in the internal affairs of the People’s Republic of China and any harm to this country’s national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and underlines the need for ... keeping order to ensure stability, welfare and security of the people of Hong Kong,” the Iranian spokesman said.  Hong Kong was witnessing a renewal of protests on Sunday over a newly-proposed security law as a lockdown imposed over the coronavirus outbreak gradually loosens.  The proposed law was recently submitted for deliberation to the National People’s Congress (NPC) and it aims to boost security measures and safeguard national security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) after violent protests rocked the region for months last year.  Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Sunday that Hong Kong was an internal affair and no foreign interference would be allowed.  “Aside from the devastation caused by the novel coronavirus, there is also a political virus spreading through the US,” Wang said, adding, “This political virus is the use of every opportunity to attack and smear China. Some politicians completely disregard basic facts and have fabricated too many lies targeting China, and plotted too many conspiracies.”  Meanwhile, White House National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien warned on Sunday that China's proposed national security legislation for Hong Kong could lead to US sanctions and threaten the city's status as a financial hub.  ""It looks like, with this national security law, they're going to basically take over Hong Kong and if they do ... Secretary (of State Mike) Pompeo will likely be unable to certify that Hong Kong maintains a high degree of autonomy and if that happens, there will be sanctions that will be imposed on Hong Kong and China,"" O'Brien said on NBC's Meet the Press.

"President Trump left the White House and hit the links this Saturday of Memorial Day weekend, playing golf for the first time since March 8–right before the coronavirus lockdowns began. Trump played at his Trump National Golf Club located in nearby Potomac Falls in Sterling, Loudoun County, Virginia.  Trump’s outing for fresh air, sunshine, exercise and camaraderie comes as the nation has turned the corner from the COVID-19 Chinese coronavirus pandemic and is slowly returning to normalcy (in red states)–but with abundant precautions as the pandemic, which has killed nearly 100,000 Americans, is expected to persist for months or years until a vaccine or herd immunity is achieved.

"MOSCOW, (Sputnik) - The power-sharing deal between Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and his rival Abdullah Abdullah will strengthen the government's bargaining power in talks with the Taliban but is not enough to bring peace to the country, experts say.  The long-time political rivals agreed to share power in the government on Sunday after months of feuding over the results of last September's election. Ghani was awarded the victory but Abdullah rejected the outcome and formed a parallel cabinet.  Hopes are that the newly found unity will help the Afghan government get the country back on track toward stability. Abdullah will now lead negotiations with Taliban insurgents that aim to end decades of fighting as the country struggles to contain the coronavirus outbreak.  Obstacles Remain  The power-sharing deal will likely strengthen the government's hand in the future talks with the Taliban but it cannot resolve the current stalemate, Marvin Weinbaum, the director for Afghanistan and Pakistan Studies at the Washington-based Middle East Institute, said.  ""Certainly, without a deal the government side would find itself in a decidedly weak bargaining position. But while the compromise deal may serve the need for the unity needed by the Afghan regime, it has not in any substantial way removed the obstacles that block progress toward reaching a peace agreement with the Taliban,"" he said.  The deal is unlikely to change the Taliban's perception of the Afghan government as a US ""puppet,"" while Ghani's decision to resume the offensive against the militants after the hospital and funeral attacks — most likely carried out by the affiliate of Daesh* (also known as ISIS/IS/Islamic State, banned as a terror group in Russia) — could be another setback to the peace process.  Uneasy Peace  Jabeur Fathally, a professor of international and comparative law at the University of Ottawa in Canada, said the Afghan president and his top negotiator apparently put their rivalry aside to avoid armed clashes between their supporters but their core differences remained and could be exploited by the Taliban.  ""This agreement will calm and ease the tension between the supporters of these two personalities and will certainly allow the resumption of dialogue with the Taliban but we will see in the next few months that the two personalities will not have the same agendas, objectives and strategies towards the Taliban,"" Fathally said.  The expert warned that insurgents will try to play on the simmering tensions between the two political heavyweights to weaken them and impose their conditions in the intra-Afghan negotiations.  Robert Jervis, a professor of international politics in the Department of Political Science at Columbia University in New York, said that infighting between the two Afghan leaders could reemerge later in the negotiating process to the detriment of the peace efforts.  ""Having Abdullah lead the delegation in negotiations with the Taliban may (slightly) increase the chance of reaching an agreement by giving multiple factions in the government incentives to work out a deal. The danger, of course, is that Ghani will be given reason to object to anything that Abdullah puts forward,"" he said.  What About the Pandemic?  The power-sharing agreement is likely to boost the government's response to the coronavirus epidemic, which has infected almost 10,000 people and killed more than 200 across Afghanistan.  ""The agreement allows for a coordinated public health response to the pandemic that was not possible under the backdrop of a political infighting that had distracted the government from focusing on the health challenge,"" Marvin Weinbaum said.  Weinbaum added that mounting a successful campaign to contain the spread of the disease would be ""exceedingly difficult"" without a nationwide ceasefire with the Taliban, whose efforts to address the epidemic in areas under their control have been limited at best.  Jabeur Fathally said the deal was not going to change a lot in Afghanis' daily life but would allow the Afghan government to have more access to international relief aid, particularly from the United States and the European Union.  *Daesh, also known as ISIS/IS/Islamic State, is a terrorist group banned in Russia and many other countries.

"Actress-turned social activist Alyssa Milano is not new to social media spats, however this time, rather uniquely, she ended up in netizens’ crosshairs because of a tiny - but vital - accessory.  Alyssa Milano has posted a snapshot of her family before a joint outing, and it all would have gone smoothly, but for her face mask, which turned out to be crocheted, and, expectedly, see-through.

"Advertisement  Even in Italy, where extended family relations run deep, Marzio Toniolo's tale of a coronavirus lockdown is unusual - four generations cooped up in one house.  They range in age from his three-year-old daughter Bianca to her great-grandfather Gino, 87. The experience tested bonds of love under the stress of cohabitation, and he believes they have passed the test.  The Toniolo family make a toast, clinking their glasses at home after cooking homemade ravioli. Toniolo, a 35-year-old elementary school teacher, his wife Chiara, 32, and their daughter, were staying in his grandparents' house in San Fiorano, a small town in northern Italy. They had moved from Milan, found jobs in local schools, and were waiting for their house in the town to be ready for moving in. Toniolo's father, Massimo, 62, was visiting from Sardinia.  A group of young people hang out listening to dance music on a boombox, by a train track. On Feb. 21, San Fiorano became part of the ""red zone"", a cluster of towns sealed off in what turned out to be a futile attempt to contain the virus.  Marzio takes a selfie as his daughter Bianca holds his face while they play “mother and baby” on a rainy day at home. ""The worst moment was when the first person in San Fiorano died. I know the son. I was already under a lot of stress,"" Toniolo said. ""That night, I almost had a panic attack and took a tranquiliser for the first time in years.""  On the fourteenth day of quarantine, Marzio’s grandmother Ines Prandini, 85, restarted an old alarm clock she's had for 30 years to ""give some sound to this time, to give some life to this time"" at home. The clampdown later was extended to cover all of Italy. After about a month, Toniolo's father returned home to Sardinia.  Marzio and his grandfather Gino play a game of cards at home. Things began settling down. But the real concern was Gino, who suffers from short-term memory loss. ""At the start, we were really afraid and did not let him go out. My grandmother used to go to church but when my grandfather started getting worse, she stopped,"" Toniolo said.  Gino and his wife Ines sleep at home on the 16th day of quarantine. Gino would go to bed early and wake up at 10 p.m. convinced it was breakfast time. He could not understand why he had to stay inside and ""coronavirus"" meant nothing to him, so the family told him the Spanish Flu had returned.  Marzio's family gather to watch a live broadcast of Pope Francis giving an extraordinary global blessing to an empty St. Peter's Square, where he urged the world to see the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) crisis as a test of solidarity and a reminder of basic values. The Spanish flu hit between 1918-1920 and people of Gino's generation heard accounts about it when they were young. ""He knew what that was and he started to understand,"" Toniolo said.  Gino goes for a walk close to his home. Gino now wears a mask and goes for a walk, sitting on a bench while neighbours keep a discreet, watchful eye. Bianca also helps Gino adapt. ""No, grandpa, there's coronavirus about. You can't kiss me!"" she told him.  Marzio takes a picture as he participates in a video conference call with colleagues and the headmaster of the primary school where he teaches, to see how everybody's classes are doing. Toniolo and his wife Chiara send their students lessons and homework project via the internet. On Sunday, Italy announced a gradual easing of restrictions.  Marzio takes a picture of Bianca painting his toenails.  Story Toniolo, his wife and daughter look forward to moving into their new home when possible, knowing that, if needed, they are just metres away from the older generation.

"© Provided/Akron Beacon Journal Plainclothes agents with the Ohio Investigative Unit are out checking to see if there's a group larger than 10, patrons congregating in open areas, or around the bar or people using pool tables and video games - all things still not alowed under the state health order.  As patrons potentially flock to bars and restaurants over the holiday weekend, extra undercover agents will be out to observe, educate and, if necessary, enforce the state’s public health order to thwart the spread of coronavirus.  The agents are part of the Ohio Investigative Unit, which is made up of plainclothes peace officers responsible for enforcing Ohio’s alcohol, tobacco and food stamp fraud laws.  Along with looking for criminal activity, the officers now are tasked with watching for potential violations of the state’s health order for restaurants and bars to safely operate during the coronavirus pandemic.  The agents can issue administrative citations, which could lead to a hearing with the Ohio Liquor Control Commission. Possible penalties include fines, suspensions or even revoking a business’ liquor permit.  “We just don’t know the compliance rate out there,” Ohio Investigative Unit Enforcement Commander Eric Wolf said. “We certainly expect that a vast majority of the places we visit will be in compliance and do what they have to do.”  Gov. Mike DeWine announced May 18 that members would be added to the investigative unit to check for compliance at bars and restaurants.  Wolf said the undercover agents don’t have a set checklist, but they will look for things such as groups larger than 10, patrons congregating in open areas or around the bar or people using pool tables and video games -- all things still not allowed under the state health order.  This will be in addition to their normal duties, like checking for underage alcohol sales and over serving, Wolf said.  To help the unit as bars and restaurants reopen their dining rooms, Wolf said the agency is adding the help of sworn officers from other agencies. Officers from the Ohio Casino Control Commission will be teaming up with the Ohio Investigative Unit. Locally, the Stark County Sheriff’s Office will be pairing deputies with agents as well, Wolf said.  The agents generally work in pairs, Wolf said, and the extra help will let them about double the amount of teams they can send out. In an ideal situation where businesses are following the rules, Wolf said officers would “leave without an establishment knowing we were even there.”  Wolf said the two main goals are observation and education. If a business is doing mostly everything right but has one or two problems, he said an officer would likely just address the issue, and help the owners comply.  He said a big part of enforcing the health order is making sure patrons also know what they need to do to comply and be safe.  “At the same time, we’re trying to get the message out that it’s the patrons' responsibility as well,” Wolf said.  Officers have been doing similar checks while bars and restaurants reopened patios. Wolf said by-and-large, the agency saw very few incidents in which they had to issue violations.  If there is an issue that rises to a violation, Wolf said it would be filed against the business’ liquor permit, and lead to a hearing with the liquor control commission.  Agents will not be shutting down businesses, he said.  The biggest question is what businesses will look like as they reopen. Wolf said people will likely fall into two camps: those who aren’t ready to dine in yet, and those who are cooped up and ready to get out of the house. He said it’s hard to know how many people will fall in each category.  “I’m curious as just about anyone out there on what’s going to happen this weekend,” Wolf said. “We just don’t know.”  Wolf said the Ohio Investigative Unit has committed to bringing on extra officers for at least two weeks. Wolf said this will let them spread out as much as they can, and help people comply, if necessary.  “That’s the biggest push is just more observation and education, and to make sure that everyone has a good and safe holiday weekend,” Wolf said.
